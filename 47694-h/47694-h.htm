are Needed</span></p></div>


<p>Why do we need Labour-Saving Houses?</p>

<p>Because:</p>

<p class="hangingindent">1.&mdash;Life is too short and time too valuable to waste in doing
work which is unnecessary and which adds little or nothing to our
comfort.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">2.&mdash;There is a scarcity of labour. Girls of the class from
which domestic servants were drawn formerly now dislike service. The
would-be employer finds it difficult to obtain servants and to keep
them when obtained.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">3.&mdash;Unless great changes are made in our houses and households
it will become even more difficult to obtain servants, because so many
professions are now open to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4"
id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> young women that they are in a position to
choose how they will earn a living.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">4.&mdash;When servants are not obtainable, the mistress is driven
to turn to and do the work of her own house. That is why a demand for
labour-saving mechanism is making itself felt.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">5.&mdash;Owing to modern inventions, it is now possible to achieve
a house in which a family may be housed and fed in comfort at half the
cost of labour which is absorbed in the labour-making house.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">6.&mdash;It is pleasanter to spend money on the things one likes
than to squander it on unnecessary coals and kitchenmaids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<div class="introquot newpage"><p>House-keeping. Home-making.</p>

<p>What do these words mean?</p>

<p>They mean so much that is vital to the individual
and to the nation that one could weep for the
stupidity which permits any untrained and ill-educated
girl to become a nurse, a cook, a housemaid,
a mother, and the mistress of a home!</p></div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>"Servants? We haven't a single-handed cook or a house-parlourmaid on
our books, madam."</p>

<p>This, in many cases, is the reply of the registry office to-day,
and as time goes on the shortage of domestic workers will become more
and more acute. Of highly-paid upper servants, with under-servants to
wait upon them, there is no lack, for the supply of persons wishing
to fill the few "plum" posts in any profession is always adequate;
but as there is a lack of under-servants, even the very rich find it
difficult to secure a satisfactory household; while the mistress who
needs a house-parlourmaid, a single-handed cook, a "general," or even
a single-handed house- or parlourmaid finds it almost impossible to
induce a suitable girl to accept her situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Why should this be?</p>

<p>"The war," says every one. "All the young women are busy conducting
tramcars, selling bacon, and punching railway tickets."</p>

<p>But why are all the young women anxious to be anything but domestic
servants?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact this dislike to service has not been brought
about by the war; it has been growing steadily for many years, and to
a great extent employers have only themselves to thank for a state of
affairs which they so bitterly deplore.</p>

<h4>The Ignorant Employer.</h4>

<p>What sane person would undertake the management of a business
knowing nothing of the conduct of it? Yet this is what young women
of the moneyed classes have done ever since it became the fashion to
despise domesticity, to imagine that housekeeping was a pursuit fit
only for women too stupid to do anything else. The girl marries: to
her, cookery and household work are deep, dark mysteries. How do you
clean silver? How long does it take to turn out a bedroom? Do you
allow 2 lbs. or 12 lbs. of margarine per week for a household of six
persons? What is dripping? The cook says soup cannot be made without
soup meat. Can't it? And what is soup meat?<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> Imagine the annoyance of
working under the control of such an employer!</p>

<p>Honest, competent servants become disheartened, the incompetent
remain incompetent, while the ignorance of the mistress makes the
temptation to be dishonest well-nigh irresistible. It is the ignorance
of the mistress also that has enabled the perquisite and commission
system (polite names for theft) to flourish, and which make it possible
for tradesmen to employ men at low wages on the tacit understanding
that a high wage may be gained by fleecing the customer.</p>

<h4>No Chance for the Incompetent Servant.</h4>

<p>Again, had the servant-employers of this country a proper knowledge
of their duties, the incompetent servant would have little chance to
exist. She would have been taught her work, and if she would not do it,
have been dismissed.</p>

<p>But nine times out of ten the mistress does not know how to teach,
and is so dependent on her servants that she must keep anyone rather
than be left servantless.</p>

<p>The result of our genteel dislike of "menial"<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> duties
has not only encouraged dishonesty and incompetence in our servants, it
has actually lessened the supply. The mistress who has never cleaned
a room or cooked a dinner cannot realise the difficulties of either
task. Hence it is that because domestic work generally has been done by
paid servants, we have made but little effort to plan and furnish our
houses in a labour-saving fashion. We have also failed to move with the
times, and to realise that no matter if we approve or disapprove, young
girls now demand more variety and more freedom in their lives than was
formerly the case.</p>


<h4>Wanted! a New Race of Mistresses.</h4>

<p>A race of competent, sympathetic mistresses might have made domestic
service one of the most sought-after of the professions open to the
average woman. They might have eliminated practically all the hard
and dirty work of the house, they might have organised regular hours
for exercise and recreation, and by their own example shown what war
is now teaching us&mdash;the incalculable value to the nation of the
good housekeeper. In their scorn of domestic duties Englishwomen
have forgotten that the sole duty of the housewife is not<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> to know
the price of mutton: it is her duty, and that of those who work with
her, to bring up a race of decently behaved, clean, well-fed people,
and to make of her home a place of peace and goodwill, a centre from
which radiates a right influence.</p>

<p>Is this the work for the woman too stupid for aught else? or is it
the work of a true patriot?</p>

<p>It is often said that the English govern their Government, and there
is truth in the statement. The Press keeps its finger on the public
pulse: when that shows signs of excitement, the Press acts, and between
them, Public and Press set Parliament moving.</p>


<h4>Domestic Training for all Girls.</h4>

<p>Possibly, in time, the serious lack of domestic labour will excite
the Public and the Press to such a pitch that the Government will
realise that every girl, no matter of what class, should be taught how
to cook and to clean and to wash, tend and feed a young child, and not
only be taught how to do these things, but impressed with the idea that
in so doing she is as surely performing her duty to her country as are
the soldier, sailor, doctor, scientist, or merchant.</p>

<p>But the fact that you teach girls these things<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> will not
cause them to become servants, you object.</p>

<p>I am by no means sure that you are right. When all girls have
been through a course of domestic training, and when they have been
impressed with the national importance of such work, they will regard
it from a point of view different from that which now obtains.</p>

<p>The girl who becomes the employer will know what she is asking of
her employée; she will realise that to labour indoors from 6.30 or 7
to 10 or 10.30 five days a week is not attractive to a young girl. The
work may not be continuous: there will be half-hours of rest and talk
with the other maids; but the fact remains that the servant is on duty
and liable to be called upon at any time during those hours.</p>

<p>The mistress, who has been a worker, will also realise how hard
and disagreeable are some of the tasks required of the servant in a
labour-making home.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the servant will know that she cannot take
advantage of the ignorance of her employer and that her employer is
not demanding of her work which she herself regards as derogatory. The
maid, too, will start knowing her work: she<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> will not have to pick it up
as best she can, often from persons knowing little more than herself.
The life of many young servants is made almost unendurable because
they have to struggle along as best they may, scolded by mistress and
upper-servant alike for not knowing what they have had no opportunity
to learn. A child in a fairly well-to-do working home, whose mother has
been a servant, goes out to service with some knowledge of her work,
but as a rule the conditions in cottages and town workers' dwellings
are so utterly different from those in the homes of the well-to-do that
the young girl can scarcely be blamed when she breaks and spoils and
makes more dust and muddle than she clears away.</p>


<h4>Domestic Training will improve the Physique of the Coming
Generation.</h4>

<p>A three or four months' course of intelligent domestic training
would do much, not only to solve the servant problem, but to improve
the physique of the coming generation, for it is sheer ignorance
of domesticity which accounts for a high percentage of the infant
mortality which is a disgrace to this country. And this ignorance
of the importance of cleanliness, sanitation, etc., is not<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> confined
to the poorer classes. Fashions filter downwards, and when the educated
women of the upper classes show that they consider household work
beneath their attention, why should they think it strange when they
find the same opinion expressed by the working-girl?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15"

<div class="introquot newpage">
<p>Ignorance of the national value of "menial work" is one reason for

<h4>Menial Work.</h4>

<p>The wide dislike of menial work which exists was brought before me
vividly a short time ago.</p>

<p>A secretary was advertised for, an educated, quick,
methodical worker&mdash;good typist and shorthandist. The lady
who needed the secretary almost required one to deal with
the letters she received in reply to her advertisement.<a
name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>A holiday nursery governess was advertised for: again with the same
result. Women with every qualification were anxious&mdash;desperately
anxious&mdash;to obtain the post. These educated women sent stamped
envelopes for a reply and offered to come long distances to secure an
interview.</p>

<p>A cook at £30 a year (single-handed) was advertised for over and
over again. Registry offices were haunted, friends worried, for tidings
of cooks. No cooks were forthcoming. Here was a situation where the two
maids had a roomy comfortable bedroom and their own bathroom,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> a
sitting-room with a gas fire and every labour-saving apparatus to make
the work easy.</p>

<p>These servants were offered not less than 10s. a week wages, as much
good food as they could eat, clean, sanitary quarters, with comfortable
beds and hot baths galore. Their washing was paid, an off-day, from
3.30 to 10, once a week, and the same on alternate Sundays, and two
weeks' holiday (on full pay) granted, in addition to as many other
outings as could be arranged.</p>

<p>Had suitable applicants appeared and demanded £30 or £34 a year,
they would have obtained those wages.</p>

  </div>
</div>


<h4>Too many Governesses, Secretaries, and Companions in Normal
Times.</h4>

<p>And yet there is a glut of women who wish to become governesses,
secretaries, companions, and shop-assistants, in spite of the fact
that such work is not well paid, that it is uncertain, and that those
girls who must take lodgings or "live in" are generally badly housed
and badly fed. Except in a few shops, girls living "in" live very
roughly. Nurses in the generality of nursing-homes do the same, and
women workers who earn under 30s. a week and live in a bed-sitting-room
in a lodging-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"
id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> are in no better case, though the latter
do have the luxury of a room to themselves. In many houses, however,
this luxury could be granted to the servants.</p>

<p>The life of a servant in a good situation is healthy; she can
enjoy cleanliness, good food, and warmth, she can take her pick of
situations, and leave one which is undesirable, knowing full well that
she can obtain another for the asking. A girl earning good wages in
service can save, and she is not dogged by the terror of being suddenly
thrown out of employment and finding herself penniless and unable to
obtain another post.</p>

<p>So much for the advantages of domestic service as a profession. What
are its drawbacks?</p>

<p>Lack of freedom and the fact that the profession of a servant is not
considered genteel! The girl who adopts it does not rank as a "young
lady."</p>


<h4>Service is not a Genteel Profession!</h4>

<p>Is it not time that we ceased to cherish such vulgar ideas?</p>

<p>War, tragic and terrible, is bringing home to us the fact
that we should honour the women who can and will work, and
despise those who exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20"
id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> merely as parasites on the labour of their
fellow-beings.</p>

<p>The educated woman who desires to earn her living has a great
chance before her. Let her do for the domestic worker what an earlier
generation of women did for the sick-nurse. As domestic workers,
educated women will be of incalculable value to the nation, and they
can secure for themselves well-paid, healthy work under reformed
conditions.</p>


<h4>Domestic Training Colleges.</h4>

<p>To bring about this change, first of all we need to establish
domestic training colleges, run on somewhat the same lines as the
Norland Nurses' Institute, where girls of good education may learn
their work and obtain certificates and character sheets. These
institutions should provide accommodation for members on holiday
or when changing their situations. They should also demand for
their members a fixed scale of wages, a reasonable standard of
food and accommodation, and free time. The workers should wear the
uniform of the institution. Well-trained girls could demand high
wages, and employers could afford to give them to conscientious,
capable workers, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21"
id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> would neither break nor spoil nor waste,
and who would disdain to practise the small dishonesties by which the
servant often augments her wages.</p>

<p>But if the educated woman worker is ready to do her part in the
scheme, her prospective employer must realise that she, too, has a duty
to perform. It rests with her so to arrange the work of her household
that the positions she has to offer shall appear desirable to the class
of woman she desires to employ.</p>


<h4>What the Servant Dislikes.</h4>

<p>To sum up the situation, the scarcity of domestic servants is
accounted for by the dislike of girls who have to earn a living for a
life which entails long hours, little freedom, and which carries with
it something of social stigma.</p>

<p>The shop-girl, the clerk, the tea-room waitress are "<em>young
ladies</em>."</p>

<p>They are known as Miss Jones or Miss Smith. The servant is a
servant, a "slavey," a "skivvy," a "Mary Jane." A young man of the
superior working class prefers to walk out with a young lady, and the
servant knows this and resents it. Even if a girl goes into a factory,
she may work harder than the servant and in many cases under less<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> pleasant
conditions, but she is free in the evening, on Saturday afternoon,
and on Sunday, and she lives amongst her equals. She does not inhabit
"servants' bedrooms," and eat "kitchen butter," and drink "kitchen
tea." The tea that she does drink may be inferior, but at all events it
is as good as that consumed by other members of her world.</p>

<p>And all these things matter, though the average employer likes to
believe that they do not.</p>


<h4>To Popularise Domestic Service.</h4>

<p>So to make domestic service popular we must make it fashionable.
It should be as fashionable to be a domestic servant as to become a
hospital nurse.</p>

<p>Alter the conditions of domestic service until the profession
of domestic worker attracts the educated woman, and the problem is
solved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23"
id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="introquot newpage"><p>"Go into Service! Not I!"</p>

<p>That is what young girls say.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do, I cannot get servants."</p>

<p>That is what the employer says.</p>

<p>What is she doing to make domestic service an attractive profession
to the young girl?</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a><br
/><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Study the psychology of the question, find out what it is young
women want of life. Be progressive. Do not say, "Because it was, it
ever shall be." Thank God, things do not stay as they were, or we might
still be working little children eighteen hours a day in factories,
starving and whipping lunatics, and burning witches.</p>

<p>Having realised that it is the human attitude which is of first
importance, then let us go on to see by what means we can lighten the
work of our households so that we may make service attractive.</p>

<p>We can solve the domestic problem&mdash;</p>

<p class="hangingindent">1.&mdash;By becoming entirely, or partly, our own servants.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">2.&mdash;By employing outside workers, who should be trained,
uniformed, and paid at a fixed rate per hour.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">3.&mdash;By changing the conditions until domestic service becomes
as attractive to the worker as any other profession open to the woman
of average ability and education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26"
id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Other changes can be made: indeed, it is certain that sooner
or later they must be made unless we are to go servantless. When
the necessary alteration of mental attitude towards the subject is
achieved, the next thing to be done is to call to our aid all the
labour-saving devices which are available, for it is by making full
use of them that we can eliminate the hard and disagreeable work from
houses and make the profession of a domestic worker attractive to an
educated woman.</p>

<p>In the industrial world it is now realised that to obtain the best
results the worker must be saved all unnecessary fatigue, and that the
mental atmosphere in which he works must be as free from strain and
anxiety as possible, for it is found that the labour of an over-tired
worker becomes practically worthless.</p>

<p>It is time we applied modern methods to the working of our
households, in which they are needed as much as in the office or the
factory.</p>

<p class="center noindent"><span class="smcap">The Labour-Saving House
as it Might be</span></p></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The other day I was re-reading that delightful story of a simple
soul, <cite>Kipps</cite>, and was struck anew by the truth of the difficulties
which beset Artie and Ann when they went house-hunting.</p>

<p>"'They build these 'ouses,' said Ann, 'as though girls wasn't 'uman
beings.... There's kitchen stairs to go up, Artie.... Some poor girl's
got to go up and down, up and down, and be tired out, jest because
they haven't the sense to leave enough space to give their steps a
proper rise; and no water upstairs anywhere&mdash;every drop got to be
carried! It's 'ouses like this wear girls out.</p>

<p>"'It's 'aving 'ouses built by men, I believe, makes all the work and
trouble....'</p>

<p>"The Kipps, you see, thought they were looking for a reasonably
simple little contemporary house, but indeed they were looking either
for dreamland or 1975 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, or thereabouts,
and it hadn't come."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
</p>


<h4>The House that Jack Built.</h4>

<p>I am inclined to agree with Ann in thinking that having houses built
by men makes at least a great part of all the work and trouble, for my
own experiences&mdash;somewhat limited, I admit&mdash;of architects
point to the fact that they are concerned to provide you with a house
which looks charming and which may be stoutly built, but that such
details as the make of the bath, the size of the service lift, the
position of the kitchen range, and the arrangements for cupboards,
housemaid's pantries, and so forth, concern them not at all.</p>

<p>When rebuilding a house for ourselves it was left to me to suggest
a service lift, and I was only by a happy chance in time to prevent
it being of such an absurd size that no good-sized joint on a dish to
correspond, or a coal scuttle, could have been put into it!</p>

<p>I also had to point out that to arrange for all the hot-water pipes
to pass through the larder seemed scarcely advisable, and that a
box-room in which all the boxes were to be stacked one upon the other
was not quite as labour-saving as one fitted with strong, cheap slatted
shelves on which the boxes could stand in tiers and be removed one at a
time as required with ease and dispatch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Men, as a general rule, do not have to keep house, neither do they
have to do <a id="corr1"></a>housework, thus it is not surprising that such details as
these escape their notice.</p>

<h4>Women Architects.</h4>

<p>For that reason every architect, if he be a man, should number a
clever, resourceful, and experienced woman amongst his staff. Or why
should not the architect be a woman?</p>

<p>Before discoursing of the labour-saving house as it might be, it
is well to state that I am well aware that one man's meat is another
man's poison, also that, owing to the fact that gas and electricity
are not always available in the country, the labour-saving house must,
more often than not, be in a town or a suburb. Still, much may be done
with the country house, even the small country house, and after all we
move quickly nowadays, and soon it may be possible to obtain gas and
electric current everywhere.</p>

<h4>A Hot and Cold Water Service.</h4>

<p>Another point which strikes me when coming to consider my
labour-saving house is this. Why do not the Water Companies
supply us with a Hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> Water Service on much the same terms as
they now supply us with a Cold Water Service?</p>

<p>Let us try and realise what this would mean to the householder. His
home would be fitted with radiators and warmed by hot water. He would
turn the radiators on and off as he needed them. He would turn a tap
and hot water would be at his command at any hour, day and night, for
baths, washing-up, and cooking. He would turn another tap and cold
water would gush forth.</p>

<p>Imagine the economy of such an arrangement! Instead of millions of
stoves heating water, there would be a few large furnaces doing the
work. Imagine, too, the difference in the atmosphere when you eliminate
coal from all dwelling-houses. The house is heated and provided with
hot and cold water on every floor, in every room if you like, with no
more trouble to yourself than turning a tap and paying the bill. When
you do not have to cook water in addition to food you need far less
fuel, and for this purpose electricity or gas are at your disposal. If
you feel lonely when sitting in a room warmed by a radiator, you may
have a small wood fire, and this, I admit, labour-saving faddist that
I am, I should desire in one or two sitting-rooms.</p> <p><span

<p>But in the ideal labour-saving house (ideal, mark you, from a
labour-saving point of view), there are no fires, no chimneys, no
grates, no coal-devouring, dirt-making range, always requiring coal and
yet more coal and returning you evil for good in the shape of soot and
dirt.</p>

<p>Have you ever watched a sweep at work? Have you ever cleaned the
flues of a coal range?</p>

<p>In our dream-house we have no such horrors. We save the cost of
chimneys, sweeps, grates, fenders, fireirons, coal-boxes. We need not
provide coal cellars, in which a cold, cross, sleepy girl must grovel
in the early morn before the house can be warmed and the breakfast
cooked.</p>

<p>Make a mental picture of all the heavy coal-boxes which are dragged
up steep stairs in this country of ours.</p>

<h4>Save a Third of the Work in the House.</h4>

<p>Eliminate coal and you save quite a third of the work in your
home. Think this out and you will see that it is so. Coal must be
delivered. In a town it is shot through a hole into the basement cellar
or cellars. This causes a cloud of black dirt, and the front of your
house suffers. Then coal must be shovelled up into scuttles; often it
is necessary to break up the large lumps. The scuttles are then carried
about the house, coals up, ashes down; grates are cleaned and the room
is powdered with dust in the process. Grates, fenders, fireirons,
and coal-boxes must be cleaned, and fashion ordains that they are
generally made, wholly or partly, of polished metal. The weather is
cold and a servant is rung for and more coal is demanded. One day the
wind blows and the fire will not light. It takes some fifteen minutes
of bellows-blowing and two bundles of wood to set it going, and then
the wind blows harder and it smokes! Alas for the poor housemaid! The
kitchen fire won't draw and the water is not hot. The sweep must be
sent for, and all the while the air is being fouled from the smoke from
our own chimneys, and when we open our windows the coal we burn returns
to us in the shape of smuts and grime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, the washing bill, the cleaner's bill! The bill for labour which
might be saved!</p>

<p>So in our ideal home we do away with all this pother, and wash and
warm ourselves by means of hot water which comes from the main and the
supply of which we regulate by turning taps. We light our house and
cook our food by means of electricity or gas, which we also regulate by
turning switches or taps. Thus we obtain heat and artificial light.</p>

<p>When Labour was cheap and plentiful, the Labour-Making House caused
but little inconvenience except to those who had to do the work, and
their point of view was seldom considered.</p>

<p>Now that Labour is scarce and dear, the matter assumes a different
complexion.</p></div>

<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>But our house must be well supplied with natural light, for without
light and air we cannot live.</p>

<p>Away, then, with basements. There must be ample space between the
rows of houses so that every room may be light, that the sun may
penetrate into it, and therefore the windows must be large.</p>


<h4>Kitchens and Offices.</h4>

<p>These, too, must be light and airy. The kitchen should not be
used as a sitting-room; it is the place in which food is prepared,
and should be a place which can be kept exquisitely clean. It should
have tiled walls and ceiling, a cemented floor on a slight slant with
a gutter, so that it may be washed down with a hose. The larder and
pantry should be arranged in a like fashion. The larder must be cool,
well ventilated, and the food stored in it protected from dust and
dirt. In our ideal home, both cook and mistress know something of the
work of dust and flies as disease carriers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In this kitchen the cooker is placed in a good light and is mounted
at a convenient height. Only the cook knows the fatigue occasioned
by stooping to lift heavy weights out of low-set ovens, the worry of
cooking in a bad light.</p>

<p>The sink, too, shall be set at a reasonable height. There shall not
be a scullery&mdash;why should there be a scullery? It is merely one
more place to clean.</p>

<p>Then we will not condemn any girl or woman to stand for hours
washing up. The electrically worked washing-up machine does such work
well and quickly, and our pots and pans when electricity or even gas is
used do not become black and sooty on the outside.</p>

<p>In the ideal kitchen we will have as few utensils as possible, and
these shall have their proper keeping places.</p>


<h4>A Service-room.</h4>

<p>In addition to kitchen and larder we will have a "service-room,"
fitted with cupboards for linen, blankets, pillows, etc., for boxes,
for china and glass. Here flowers may be done, clothes brushed, and
half a hundred domestic jobs performed. Here there may be a hot-airing
cupboard, a place in which to wash and iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Tiled walls and ceiling, varnished wood, linoleum-covered floor,
tables covered with American cloth nailed tight or faced with zinc are
quickly and easily cleaned.</p>

<p>In addition there must be a maids' sitting-room, light, bright,
sparsely but comfortably furnished, with linoleum-covered floor and
small, light rugs which may be shaken easily.</p>

<p>And in a convenient place, so that it may be fed from kitchen and
pantry, there must be the service lift.</p>

<p>Here we have such domestic premises as are suitable in a house where
three or more servants will be employed.</p>

<p>The large household will need a housekeeper's room, a sitting-room
for the housemaids, a dining-hall, but in this book such households
cannot be considered. On the other hand, the one or two-servant house
or flat may be differently planned. Here pantry, sitting-room, and
service-room might be combined, and this suggestion is dealt with in
another chapter; while in the no-servant home, or that in which some of
the work is done by the visiting domestic worker, a sitting-room is not
needed, and kitchen and pantry may be combined. A small service-room,
however, I would not omit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44"
id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> in a house where there are spare bedding,
china, linen, boxes, and so forth to be stowed away; and a house in
which there is no place to do odd jobs cannot be an ideal home.</p>

<h4>Furniture and Decoration.</h4>

<p>The furnishing and decoration of a house must be left to individual
taste: one person revels in colouring which would make another ill,
but when we consider the matter from a labour-saving point of view,
we should forbid painted woodwork. Natural wood should be used and
mouldings forbidden. Who does not know the lines of dirt which form
on the mouldings in which the builder delights? The wainscots, the
window-frames, the doors, all are trimmed with mouldings. Fitted
carpets, or, indeed, any heavy carpets, should be taboo. Parquet
floors are delightful, but in most places linoleum must be the floor
covering because it keeps out draughts, is easily kept clean, and is
comparatively cheap.</p>

<p>Furniture which cannot be moved without difficulty or swept under
is objectionable: double beds are tiring for one person to make,
and washhandstands can be omitted if there are a suitable number
of washing-rooms. These are preferable,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> I think, to fitted
washstands in the bedrooms. In the average house three washing-rooms
would be required, one for husband and wife, one for the children, and
one for the servants. When spare rooms are required each bedroom and
dressing-room should have its washing-room.</p>

<p>You may say that so many bathrooms absorb much space and cost so
much more.</p>

<h4>A Clever Idea for a Bedroom and Dressing-room Bath.</h4>

<p>This idea has been carried out in a small country house known to
me.</p>

<p>Here the spare bedroom and dressing-room are 16 feet wide. Where the
dividing wall would come a fitted washstand has been arranged in either
room, back to back. The washstands jut out 1 foot 8 inches into either
room, and are 3 feet long, leaving, if you draw a straight line to
either side wall, and allowing for a partition wall, a space 3 feet 8
inches wide and 10 feet long. This space is enclosed on either side by
sliding doors, fitted with bolts, and inside it a porcelain enamel bath
is fitted. There is a ventilating window at the outer wall, and that
piece of wall is tiled as is the floor.</p>

<p>A large-sized bath measures some 30 inches<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> across the widest end, and
is 6 feet long. A small bath measures some 28 inches by 5 feet, so if
the rooms were small and a small bath chosen a lesser space would be
necessary for the bathroom, and part of the length might be used for
wardrobe cupboards.</p>

<p>In this house the water and the radiators are heated by a coke
furnace, the house is lighted by acetylene gas, and the cooking is done
by coal, and the cooker is so arranged that it heats servants' hall as
well as kitchen.</p>

<p>In a labour-saving house all rooms should be under rather than over
furnished, and free of heavy, stuffy draperies. There should be a gas
ring or electric heater in each room or on each floor, so that in the
case of illness food can be prepared. Hot water there will always be,
day and night.</p>

<p>Of polished metal there should be a minimum, and glass rather than
silver should be chosen for table use. Stainless steel knives take the
place of those which need cleaning. The meals should be simplified as
much as possible. Earthenware casseroles in which the food is cooked
and served save washing up. Rotary brushes by which boot and other
cleaning may be carried out are worked by electricity. Linoleum with
rubber treads is substituted for stair carpets whenever possible, in
order to save carpet beating and the cost of stair-rods. The use of a
suction cleaner, Bissel carpet sweeper, long-handled scrubbing brushes
and mops, telephone bells, an electric "not at home" indicator on the
front door, a polished dining-table, glass tops to sideboard, side, and
dressing-tables will all reduce the labour bill. It is also important
that each person in the house should refrain from making unnecessary
work for the others, for to tidy up after an untidy person absorbs far
more time than is often realised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
</p>

<p>But, alas! such a home as I have described is not within the reach
of many people. Like the Kipps, we are looking for Dreamland or 1975,
and it has not come. Still, there are people who build houses and there
are more people who rebuild houses, and large numbers who do up houses,
and if one cannot do all one would like, it is generally possible to
achieve some of one's ambitions.</p>

<p class="center noindent"><span class="smcap">The Labour-Saving House
as it can be</span></p></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was an Irishman who advised, "If ye can't be aisy, be as aisy as
ye can," and his advice was good.</p>

<p>Thus, if you cannot have an ideal house, have a home which is as
nearly ideal as possible, so let us consider the house as we generally
find it, and see what can be done to improve it.</p>

<p>Most houses built prior to the last ten years seem to have been
planned with the express desire of providing an unnecessary amount of
hard work for the unfortunate persons who inhabit them. Fifty years
ago labour was cheap and plentiful, and ideas as to hygiene stranger
even than many which still obtain. Now, however, we do know that
fresh air and light are as necessary to our well-being as sound food.
This fact is shown in an interesting fashion in Mrs. Pember Reeves'
admirable book, "Round About a Pound a Week," in which she<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> speaks
eloquently of the way in which "basement families" deteriorate in
health, although the children may have more food than those who live in
higher, airier quarters.</p>


<h4>Basement Houses.</h4>

<p>Ignorance of the value of light and air, cheap labour and dear land
were no doubt the causes of basement houses, and to this day, although
labour is dear and the cost of feeding and keeping each servant has
increased, it is no uncommon thing for a housekeeper to remark, "I have
to keep an extra servant because of the basement," and perhaps another
maid is employed because of the coals and stairs.</p>

<p>Where the income is ample, the extra labour bill is of little
importance (speaking from the employer's point of view), but
householders of moderate and small means are rapidly discovering that
labour-making houses are not for them; that it is an economy to pay, if
needs be, a rather higher rent and to live in a healthy, light, airy
house, so planned that all unnecessary toil is abolished, and with it
the cost of much cleaning material, chimney-sweeping, whitewashing,
etc.</p>

<p>In many cases, landlords have found it impossible<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> to
let their gloomy, inconvenient dwellings to tenants of the desired
kind, and what was a "good neighbourhood" has sunk by degrees until
the houses are inhabited by members of that unfortunate class who are
forced to take any rooms they can obtain, and only too often pay a high
price for bad accommodation. I am not in a position to advise on the
management of house property, but I cannot but think that in many cases
it would pay the owners to modernise the houses they have to let rather
than let them deteriorate.</p>

<p>As I write, I have in my mind's eye a certain neighbourhood in
London, once fashionable, now inhabited by "nice" people, whose means
make it impossible for them to pay high rents. But this neighbourhood
is slowly but surely deteriorating, and rents are sinking, simply
because the houses are of a kind that necessitate at least three
servants being employed, in addition to a nurse if there are young
children. With less than three servants these houses could not be kept
clean or warm.</p>


<h4>A Typical Labour-Making House.</h4>

<p>The accommodation in most of these streets and squares consists
of:</p>

<p><i>Basement</i> (deep and rather dark).&mdash;Kitchen,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> pantry,
servants' hall at back (generally very dark), lavatory, coal and wine
cellars; front area (dustbin stands here), backyard; steep and dark
stairs to ground floor.</p>

<p><i>Ground Floor.</i>&mdash;Dining-room, smoking-room, and third small
dark room, lavatory, narrow hall, and steep stairs leading to small
half-landing.</p>

<p><i>First Floor.</i>&mdash;Double drawing-room. Above, seven bedrooms, one
lavatory, and one bathroom.</p>

<p>All coal for the house must be carried up one, two, or three, and
possibly four, flights of steep stairs.</p>

<p>There is a large kitchen range, with flues to clean twice a week, as
in order to keep up the hot-water supply much coal is burned, and the
flues become very dirty.</p>

<p>The chimney must also be swept every two months. Other chimneys must
be swept twice a year; if much used, three times a year. All food and
table utensils must be carried up and downstairs three times a day, and
when lunch and dinner are in progress a servant must run up and down
with clean and dirty dishes, etc.</p>

<p>Washstands are used in each bedroom, and hot water taken
to these rooms three or four times a day. There is but one
bathroom and upstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57"
id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> lavatory; therefore there is a good deal
of stair work when doing the rooms. If there is a nursery, the nursery
meals have to be carried up and down.</p>

<p>Each time the hall-door bell rings, a maid must run upstairs to
answer it, and visitors and tea in the drawing-room necessitate more
journeys up and down, and the carrying of a heavy tray.</p>

<p>Now, with a house of this description there are certainly two ways
of converting it into a labour-saving dwelling.</p>


<h4>A Labour-Making House Converted.</h4>

<p>If the basement is deep and incurably dark, by far the best plan is
to dispense with it altogether so far as living-rooms are concerned,
using it merely for cellars and box-room.</p>

<p>"But," says the householder, "there will now be no back door. The
tradesmen will all have to come to the front door." They will. But
tradesmen call chiefly in the morning, and the few who come in the
afternoon might be instructed to go to the area door, to which the
dustman would also go, while the coals (if any are used) would be
delivered through the pavement coal-shoot as before.</p>

<p>Arranging thus, the house proper begins on the ground floor.
The large front room is the dining-room<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> as before, and the double
doors between it and the erstwhile smoking-room should be plastered
up on the smoking-room side, for under the new arrangement the
smoking-room becomes the kitchen, and the small third room the pantry.
The kitchen will not be large, but neither a gas nor an electric cooker
takes up much space.</p>

<p>Now comes the question whether the hot-water system shall be worked
by a coke or a gas circulator. The latter gives even less trouble than
the former, but it may prove too costly in use. A coke furnace needs
to be stoked about three times a day, and is very easy to light. The
furnace might be placed in the kitchen or in the basement, and in it
can be burned practically all the rubbish, thus doing away with that
otherwise nasty necessity the dustbin, which in many parts of London
the authorities refuse to empty more than once a week.</p>

<p>Kitchen and pantry must be fitted with sinks, and there should be a
little gas fire, work-table, and armchair in the pantry for the use of
the house-parlourmaid.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Two servants can easily do the work of a house such as this will
become, and the kitchen premises are only suitable for two servants.
Extra help, however, can always be employed in times of stress. In
order that two women may keep the house in thorough order, gas fires
should be used in all rooms other than perhaps the drawing-room and
the nursery, though now that gas fires have been brought to such a
state of perfection I can see no reason why there should not be gas in
the nurseries. The double drawing-room must be made into drawing-room
and smoking-room, thus leaving seven bedrooms as before, or it may
suit the family to keep the double drawing-room, and make an upstairs
smoking-room.</p>

<p>Personally I should use the first floor front room as drawing-room,
and open the doors into the smoking-room when more space was
needed, thus leaving best bed and dressing-room, two nurseries, one
servants' room, and one spare room, and a small room to be used
as linen and dress room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62"
id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> (Boxes could be stored in the empty
basement.) Add to the house a second bathroom and lavatory, telephone
bells; use the bathroom basins rather than the bedroom washstands (and
when a bathroom can be set apart for Monsieur and Madame, and another
for nursery and maids, this is scarcely a hardship), and you now have a
house which, provided it is not crammed with furniture, stuffy carpets,
and draperies, can be perfectly kept by two good servants, always
supposing that the nurse does not demand too much waiting on.</p>

  </div>
</div>


<h4>Nurse and Nursery.</h4>

<p>If this important person has a bathroom conveniently situated, gas
fires, a gas ring for heating kettles, irons, etc., and a cupboard
containing her own stock of crockery, she should give very little
trouble to the house-parlourmaid. If advisable, a charwoman one day a
week could turn out the nurseries, tidy the front area and backyard,
clean the stairs and bathrooms.</p>

<p>Arranging the house thus, the following work is saved: Cleaning of
kitchen range and flues, carrying of coal all over house, running up
and downstairs to answer front door, especially in morning, when the
cook is busy, carrying of trays from basement,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> cleaning and filling coal
scuttles, cleaning grates and fireirons, much carrying of hot water and
bedroom work, entire cleaning of basement.</p>

<p>If a coke furnace is used, coke is light to carry and clean to
handle, and should a buttery hatch be arranged between dining-room and
kitchen, one maid (if well trained) can wait on six or eight persons
quite satisfactorily. Then when a little dinner is given, a charwoman,
at one shilling and her supper, to help wash up, is the only outside
help which is necessary.</p>

<p>Now I cannot but think that a house such as I have described would
let at £120 a year, where now many of them are let at £90, and as time
goes on will fetch less and attract a less desirable style of tenant.
Considering the saving in upkeep of a basement, labour, food and keep
of one maid, and the shrinkage of general expense which occurs when
two maids are kept rather than three, it would pay the tenant well to
expend the extra £30 a year. Even were the saving of expense no object,
the additional comfort of a labour-saving house is worth the extra
rent.</p>

<p>With the cost of heating by gas rather than coal I will deal
later, but it must always be borne in mind that with coal range
and coal fires in, say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64"
id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> three or four rooms in such a house the
labour is made far greater, and also the rooms become far dirtier.</p>

<p>In my own dining-room, where there is a gas fire, the dirt and
dust is most noticeably less than in the drawing-room, where we burn
coal.</p>

<p>I said at the beginning of this chapter that there were at least two
methods of turning labour-making into labour-saving houses. Let us now
suppose that we have to deal with another basement house, but that in
this case the basement is neither deep nor dark.</p>

<h4>A Second Suggestion for a Labour-Saving House.</h4>

<p>The front room is quite light and cheerful, with a good view of the
street. The back room is rather dark, and has a narrow area facing into
a strip of garden. The house contains but five bedrooms, so that the
basement cannot well be spared. Here I would use the front room (made
very light and gay with paper and paint) as a combination servants'
sitting-room, pantry, and store-room. The kitchen should be tiled if
feasible&mdash;if not, papered with a white-tiled paper&mdash;and
floored with black-and-white linoleum in order to make it as light as
possible. The back area must be enlarged so as to give more light and
air, and some steps should lead into the garden, where the maids can
sit in hot weather. At present the basement consists of a front room
and kitchen, coal cellars under the pavement, a lavatory, and a little
piece at the end of the passage leading to the back area, which can be
arranged for a knife- and boot-cleaning place. But there is no larder.
This must be built. A door is cut to lead out of the kitchen into a
tiny lobby, out of this lobby one door opens into the white-tiled,
well-ventilated larder, and the other into the area.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The basement is now as light and airy as any basement can be. There
is no scullery, but that apartment is unnecessary in most houses and
certainly unnecessary in a small house where two, or at most three,
servants are employed, and which contains a pleasant room in which they
can sit and have their meals. The kitchen should be fitted with a gas
or electric cooker and a gas or coke hot-water furnace. The front room
is warmed by a gas stove, and in order to make up for the extra work
entailed by the basement, a service lift is installed, with double
hatches opening from kitchen and pantry, and from dining-room and
smoking-room, which are directly over the kitchen and pantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
</p>

<p>This house is completed by a ground floor cloakroom and two
bathrooms, gas fires everywhere but in the drawing-room, telephone
bells, and in each room a tiny gas ring, so that in case of illness or
other emergency hot water or hot food can be obtained without troubling
the maids. With all these labour-saving arrangements two servants
are able to do the work with ease, and to do it in such a way as is
required by English gentlepeople, who entertain more than do their
compeers in continental countries.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>But in addition to structural labour-saving arrangements, these
rearranged houses are furnished in a labour-saving manner.</p>

<p>Except in the drawing-room, there is as little furniture as
possible, for crowded rooms are difficult to clean and take a long time
to keep in order.</p>

<p>Wherever it is seemly, the floors are fitted with linoleum, for
no other floor covering is so cleanly or so easy to keep in good
condition. When there are rugs, they are sufficiently light to be
easily shaken. Fitted carpets are taboo. Had money been no object the
floors of the sitting-rooms would have been of polished wood, but in
these two cases the surrounds were of linoleum and the carpets square,
tightly strained and not of too thick a pile. These can be quickly
swept with a Bissel sweeper and cleaned from time to time with a
suction cleaner, while of course long-handled mops are used for the
linoleum.</p>

<p>In kitchen and pantry the supply of pots and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> pans,
china, etc., is limited to what is necessary, and but little silver is
used. Most of the food is cooked and served in casseroles, and so the
washing up is lessened. The knives are of stainless steel and merely
need washing.</p>

<p>In the two cases quoted the people who inhabited the houses were of
the class who are accustomed to luxury, and a considerable amount of
door opening, telephone answering, and informal entertaining had to be
allowed for.</p>

<p>Without labour-saving arrangements, four servants, or three with a
charwoman twice a week, would have been needed to do the work really
well in the larger house, while three would have been required in the
smaller house.</p>

<p>But supposing that the family was small and a simpler style of
living needed, and that little or no entertaining took place, the
mistress of the house and one good servant could have done the work of
either house without undue strain and allowing each an ample amount of
free time.</p>

<p>Those people who talk as if doing the work of the house was a
pleasant occupation for one's spare hours speak without understanding
of their words. The keeping of her house must be the profession of the
servantless woman, but by adopting labour-saving methods she may yet
have time and energy for other interests.</p>

a Labour-Saving House</span>
</p></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Those women who have never been obliged to undertake any domestic
duties have little idea of the amount of work which has to be done in
the average house.</p>

<p>The following is a list of duties, and we must add to it the
answering of bells, tidying up after untidy people, any personal
services required (in many cases this is considerable), door opening,
telephone answering, letter posting, note and message taking, "running
out" for things which have been forgotten, whistling for cabs, waiting
in the hall to see visitors out, etc., window cleaning, washing,
mending, listing house linen for the laundry, extra work at special
cleaning times, sweeps' visits, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74"
id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<h4>Household Duties.</h4>

<p>Light kitchen fire; one or two days a week clean flues and
thoroughly clean range.</p>

<p>Get in coal.</p>

<p>Clean doorstep and brasses.</p>

<p>Make tea, cut bread and butter, and take trays and hot water to
bedrooms. Draw curtains, put washstands and possibly baths ready. Brush
clothes, clean and take up boots.</p>

<p>Sweep stairs, do hall and sitting-rooms, grates and coals.</p>

<p>Get breakfast and set and serve it for servants and dining-room.</p>

<p>Clear and wash up. Knife cleaning. Area or backyards to brush out.
Kitchen and back premises to clean.</p>

<p>Housework and turning out of rooms. Polishing bright metal, silver
cleaning and pantry work of all kinds.</p>

<p>Cooking, washing up and cleaning after cooking. Keep a supply of
coal ready.</p>

<p>Laying, serving, and washing up lunch and servants' dinner.</p>

<p>Tidying the washstands after lunch.</p>

<p>Tea. Shutting up rooms, bedroom work, hot water, etc. Wash up
tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75"
id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Dinner. Cooking, washing up and tidying. Pantry work. Servants'
supper. Bedroom work, hot bottles. Bed.</p>

<p>These duties entail rising at any hour between six and seven, bed
at any time between nine and eleven, at the best a fourteen and a half
hours' day, during which hours in an easy situation the maid will
have two and a half hours for meals (though parlourmaids and general
servants cannot always enjoy uninterrupted meals), and about one and
a half hours for reading, working, etc., leaving a ten-hour working
day. From this deduct half a day a week and half of each alternate
Sunday.</p>

<p>I contend that quite a third of this labour might be eliminated,
and what remained greatly lightened by the adoption of labour-saving
methods.</p>

<p>The following experiences are interesting as depicting the
extraordinary difference in the amount of work which is exacted in a
labour-making and a labour-saving home.</p>

<h4>Labour Making.&mdash;A House-Hunting Experience.</h4>

<p>"It has fallen to my lot of late to inspect quite a large number of
furnished houses and flats, and although my peregrinations have been
limited to dwellings in what are known as 'good situations,'<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> at
fairly high rents, I have found such dirt and disorder as surely should
only be excused by dire poverty.</p>

<p>"As a general rule the sitting-rooms were more or less clean, but
in few cases did bathrooms and lavatories, kitchen and servants'
premises fulfil the pleasant anticipations induced by the sight of the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Stained and blackened walls, dirty-looking baths, fusty sinks, make
one long for 'seven maids with seven mops,' and even with their help I,
like the carpenter, am doubtful of the success of their labours.</p>

<p>"Three, at all events, of the flats which I visited were so
furnished that it was impossible to keep them clean, while several
others might have been properly kept, given the services of a housemaid
determined to clean in spite of every obstacle.</p>

<p>"Very naturally, however, there are few such treasures to be met
with, and I cannot but feel that it would be sad to waste them upon
mistresses with so little idea of domestic sanitation as must have been
the ladies who inhabited these flats.</p>

<p>"Only one of the flats and two of the houses on the long lists
submitted to me did I find really well arranged and well kept.
This state of affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77"
id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> may be explained to some small extent by
the fact that people who take a pride in their houses or who have just
had them done up do not let them.</p>

<p>"Still, although a house may be shabby it still may be clean and
arranged in such a way as to enable the servants to perform their
duties with good results and no unnecessary trouble. Now, let me
describe to you one flat which I regard as an example of everything
which a dwelling in a dirty town should not be.</p>

<p>"It was an apartment consisting of three sitting-rooms, four
bedrooms, bath, pantry, and kitchen. The long passage-hall of good
width was very dark, partly because its four large windows had been
so treated that hardly any light penetrated through them, and partly
because the walls were papered dark green. As I progressed down this
dismal tunnel I caught my foot in some obstruction and fell against a
large piece of furniture. The servant then turned on the electric light
and I discovered that the floor was covered with felt and by no less
than twelve rugs, in a large hole in one of which I had caught my foot.
By this time I had quite decided that nothing would induce me to take
such a flat; but, like Barry Pain's Eliza,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> my love of looking
over other people's houses is so great that I continued my tour of
inspection.</p>

<p>"The dining-room was crammed with large and handsome pieces of
furniture, so large and so many that nothing less clever than a
pantomime contortionist could have waited at table when the diners had
taken their places.</p>

<p>"The walls were dark red and dirty; the curtains of thick padded and
lined tapestry were stiff and sticky with grime.</p>

<p>"In the drawing-room there was more really beautiful furniture and
some exquisite Persian rugs on a dirty felt carpet. The curtains were
of brocade, and there was a quantity of valuable china, much of it, sad
to say, badly cracked.</p>

<p>"It was a room in which only an experienced housemaid should
have been trusted, and much time should have been allowed to clean
it satisfactorily. But a cook and a young house-parlourmaid were
responsible for all the work of the flat. In the bedrooms dresses
and coats hung on pegs on the doors, and cardboard boxes were piled
on the tops of wardrobes and under the beds. The bath was minus most
of its paint, the double bedroom for the servants was furnished with
a strange collection of lumber, and the kitchen was frankly<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> dirty,
one corner of it being taken up by a lovely old walnut wood
 <a id="corr2"></a>tallboys in a shocking state of ill-usage.</p>

<p>"Now, although this was certainly the worst of the flats and houses
at which I looked, it was no uncommon thing to find dresses hanging
out in the dust, boxes piled under beds, ill-kept baths and sinks, and
floors so covered that it must take hours of work every week to keep
them more or less clean.</p>

<p>"Indeed the result of my house-hunting led me to think that the
average woman decorates, furnishes, and arranges her house in order to
make it as difficult as it can be made to keep it clean."</p>

<h4>How we manage with One Servant in our Labour-Saving House.</h4>

<p>"I have always been interested in your labour-saving ideas. I
married, and we were comfortably off. We have a tiny London house and I
arranged to have gas fires, cooker, and circulator, service lift, and
also a rubbish destructor, as I hate nasty-smelling dustbins.</p>

<p>"We can only have one bathroom, but there is hot and cold water, a
sink and slop sink on the top floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80"
id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gas fires are much improved and ours are really attractive to look
at and well ventilated; but of course I would rather have coal to sit
by, and we did have two coal fires at first; but now, since the war,
I have all gas, because we are far worse off and living is so dear,
and instead of two maids I now have only a general servant. We used to
entertain in a mild sort of way a very great deal, but most of that
naturally has come to an end.</p>

<p>"My husband is delicate, and I don't like him to have cold meals at
night, so when 'General Jane' is out (and I let her go out as often as
possible), we have dinner laid, and soup, a hot dish such as braised
cutlets, chicken en casserole, stewed steak (often it's silverside
really), with vegetables in it, and a dish of potatoes put ready on a
heater on a side table I keep for the purpose. There is a cold sweet,
so we do very well. I clear everything away and put dishes, etc., into
the lift, which takes about six or seven minutes.</p>

<p>"Our bedrooms are linoleum floored and very empty. My own researches
into domesticity prove to me that a crowded room is a bane to the
housemaid. Our ex-parlourmaid, an admirable worker, told me that our
rooms 'took half the time to clean than most.'"</p>

<p>"I have an idea about gas cookers: they should be made longer and
not so high, then they could be mounted at a convenient height. But I
suppose they are planned to take up as little space as possible. It's
all the stooping that makes domestic work so tiring.</p>

<p>"Jane does not go out until six o'clock on weekdays, and 3.30
every Sunday. We always go out to tea on Sundays, and the supper is
left ready. We keep the house clean and have nice cooking and things
well served and are very comfortable. I have people to lunch now and
then and intimate friends to dinner, and by means of my hot plate and
careful choosing of food, our Jane is dressed for lunch and able to
wait at table, and I doubt if it occurred to anyone that there was not
a cook in the kitchen. Not that it would have mattered if it had!"</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<h4>A Five Bedroom and Three Sitting-room London House.</h4>

<p>"I have been much interested in your labour-saving articles. I
send you a description of our new house. We have adopted many of your
ideas.</p>

<p>"The family consists of myself and husband and two just-grown-up
daughters.</p>

<p>"It so happened that some months ago we lost a little money, and we
also came to the conclusion that we had been for some time spending
more than we should have spent. Our house was rather expensive for our
means; we kept five servants, entertained considerably in a simple
manner, and lived easily. Finally, we decided to sell the house and
take one which was smaller and possible to<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> run with a lessened staff,
and, at the same time, if the servant difficulty became more acute,
such a house as would attract domestics by reason of its labour-saving
arrangements. A house was found, light, airy, quiet, in the required
position, of suitable size, but absolutely lacking in modern
improvements. As it stood it consisted of:</p>

<p>"<i>Basement.</i>&mdash;Large front kitchen, back room (dark), lavatory,
good wide shallow front area, easy stairs up to first floor, a
washhouse built out from back room, two cellars, small wine cellar, no
larder.</p>

<p>"<i>Ground Floor.</i>&mdash;Dining and back dining-room (double doors),
fairly wide hall, and passage out to garden at back, and lavatory (very
old-fashioned).</p>

<p>"<i>First Floor.</i>&mdash;Front and back drawing-rooms&mdash;total
length, 28 feet; width of front room, 18 feet; back room, 12 feet.</p>

<p>"<i>Second Floor.</i>&mdash;Two bedrooms.</p>

<p>"<i>Third Floor.</i>&mdash;Two bedrooms, large cupboard on top
landing.</p>

<p>"Neither electric light, bathroom, nor hot water. A satisfactory
lease could be had, and owner would put in new drainage and put house
in outside repair. Rent only £100 a year if tenant would spend a
certain sum on the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89"
id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"For convenience I will call ourselves Mr. and Mrs. A. After much
consideration Mr. and Mrs. A. came to the conclusion that they would
take the house and spend £350 in structural alterations.</p>

<p>"After this had been decided, and the work begun, the war broke out,
and Mr. A.'s income fell (at all events temporarily) to about £1,100 a
year. He was, however, still in a position to spend £350 owing to the
sale of the first house, for which a good premium had been obtained,
and, being a person of some wisdom, he realised that the £350 would
certainly swell into £500, though of that sum a part would be spent on
decoration and moving expenses.</p>

<p>"The arrangement of the house was to be as follows:</p>

<p>"<i>Basement.</i>&mdash;<i>Front Room</i> (already fitted with white-glazed
sink and tiled back) to be used for pantry, servants' hall, workroom.
Gas stove, linoleum on floor, green paint (varnished), light floral
paper. Room was very light when furnished, and pleasant. It was
supplied with a large linen cupboard and fitment cupboard for work
materials and dress stands, pantry things, spare glass and china,
chintzes, pillows, blankets, etc. This was fitted right across the end
of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90"
id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Back Room: Kitchen.</i>&mdash;Here a hot-water furnace to burn coke
and rubbish and to heat water for pantry and kitchen, three lavatory
basins, two bathrooms, and one large radiator in hall was installed;
gas cooker, white-glazed sink, white-tiled paper, green varnished
paint; service lift from kitchen to back dining-room, cleverly arranged
to open either from pantry or kitchen, and to serve dining-room
or back dining-room (to be used as smoking-room). A door was cut
into the washhouse, which was connected by a lobby with a door with
perforated zinc panels, opening into back area to ventilate kitchen and
prevent the hot air from reaching the larder; large window in larder,
white-tiled walls. Back area enlarged to give more light and air to
kitchen. All basement paint green varnished, white-tiled paper, stairs
recased, telephone bells to all floors.</p>

<p>"<i>Ground Floor.</i>&mdash;<i>Dining-room.</i> Panelled walls, mahogany
finished doors and lift hatch. By means of lift servant need not leave
the room while waiting. Gas fire and ring with heater for hot plates,
etc., over it; linoleum parquet surround, square carpet.</p>

<p>"<i>Smoking-Room.</i>&mdash;Ditto in all respects save for furniture
and gas ring. Telephone here, can be<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> heard in basement; lift
also opens into this room. If dinner-party for more than eight is
given, the double doors can be opened and dinner served from this
opening of the lift.</p>

<p>"<i>Hall.</i>&mdash;Linoleum and rugs; passage into garden continued and
widened, making extension large enough for a cloakroom, hot water,
w.c., basin, etc. Over the hall extension, small new bedroom, just
large enough for folding bed, dressing-table, fitted washstand, tiny
hanging cupboard. Large window and glass doors, muffled, to give light
to stairs.</p>

<p>"<i>Double Drawing-room.</i>&mdash;The only coal fire and fitted carpet
in the whole of the house; pile carpet up to next half-landing, after
that fitted linoleum with rubber treads to edges of stairs.</p>

<p>"<i>Second Half-Landing.</i>&mdash;Bathroom. Tiled dado, lavatory, and
wash basins, glass shelves.</p>

<p>"<i>Second Floor: Bedrooms.</i>&mdash;Green linoleum, rugs, small beds,
gas fire and gas ring for kettles.</p>

<p>"<i>Third Floor: Half-Landing.</i>&mdash;Bathroom. Tiled dado, lavatory,
hand basin, and hot cupboard for airing and for housemaid's brushes.</p>

<p>"<i>Third Floor.</i>&mdash;Girl's room in front, gas fire and ring. Room
for two maids at back. Linoleum everywhere, small beds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92"
id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"All paint on stairs, hall, gentlemen's cloakroom black. Electric
light everywhere.</p>

<p>"The house now consisted of a double drawing-room, dining-room,
smoking-room, five bedrooms, kitchen, pantry, servants' hall and
workroom combined, gentlemen's cloakroom and two bathrooms.</p>

<p>"The income did not permit of more than two servants being employed,
namely, single-handed cook and house-parlourmaid; wages £26 each. In
addition they arranged two days a week for a charwoman. One week, on
Wednesday, she turned out the drawing-room, which contained valuable
glass, furniture, and china (not at all a labour-saving room!); the
other week turned out the dining-room and tidied the drawing-room. In
the afternoon she washed and ironed blouses, handkerchiefs, etc., which
had already been put to soak, and in some cases washed, by one of the
girls. On Friday she turned out the hall and cloakroom, and scrubbed
out the basement, and did the cook's work, that being the cook's day
out. The dinner, of a suitable order, was left ready by the cook. The
regular work of the house was arranged thus:</p>

<p>"<i>Cook.</i>&mdash;Clean doorstep, do hall and dining-room and
cloakroom, all kitchen work and sweeping and dusting of servants' hall,
clean boots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93"
id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>House-parlourmaid.</i>&mdash;Do smoking-room and drawing-room and
first flight of stairs before breakfast at 8.45. Bedrooms, etc.
Dressed for lunch at 1.30; usual parlourmaid's duties. Each Wednesday
fortnight, as she has nothing to do in the drawing-room, turns out
smoking-room before breakfast. Special work: Monday, silver; Tuesday,
one bedroom; Wednesday, silver; Thursday, one bedroom; Friday, silver;
Saturday, stairs and bathrooms.</p>

<p>"It was arranged the family would use the bathrooms and that no
bedroom or washstand work would be needed. Each person stripped and
turned back her bed and left it to air and ready to be made. One
daughter helped to make beds and did a certain amount of washing of
oddments, using the nearest bathroom and keeping a folding table for
ironing in her bedroom, where there was a gas ring for the irons.</p>

<p>"The three ladies undertook all mending, and arranging of flowers.
Each member of the family promised to leave lavatory basins washed and
wiped out after use and to avoid by untidiness and carelessness giving
any extra trouble.</p>

<p>"Arranging the work in this way the trials of a two-maid household
were banished, for there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94"
id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> ample time for pantry work and the
house-parlourmaid to be dressed in time for lunch, while days out made
no difference to the household.</p>

<p>"With a little careful management of the menu and the help of the
lift the one maid could wait on eight people at lunch or dinner if
necessary, and there was no necessity for the harassing 'Oh, we mustn't
ask people to tea on Wednesday or to lunch on Friday' atmosphere.
Needless to say, without a lift, telephone bells, and fitted 'washing
rooms,' linoleum-covered floors, uncrowded rooms, gas cooker, and
hot-water furnace, which does not require flue cleaning and needs but
little attention, it would be impossible to keep a London house of the
size spick and span, and run in the way in which people accustomed to a
larger establishment expect. The furnace consumes about two scuttlefuls
of coke a day, and needs paper, wood, and a little coal to start it.
Half an hour suffices to heat the bath water. After breakfast rubbish
of all kinds is burned, and but little heat is needed for the remainder
of the day, unless baths at night are required. A kettle is kept on the
furnace, or when any dish is to be simmered slowly it can stand on the
furnace, and the gas stove burned only when quite necessary. In hot
weather the furnace is let out after lunch."</p>

<h4>A Labour-Saving Country House.</h4>

<p>"I have just read your article, and should like to tell you of
a house my husband and I have just built. We have occupied it for
eight months, and therefore have tested the various labour-saving
contrivances. It was built and designed under my direction, in order
to save all unnecessary labour. The house is warmed by central heating
and electric radiators, and there is a radiator and complete gas range
in the kitchen. We have a double earthenware sink, with two sets of
taps, in the kitchen, and no scullery. The furniture is oak, and only
needs dusting, and there is no brasswork anywhere. The fireplaces are
entirely of white tiles, and we have no use for fireirons. The steps
to the front and side doors are of marble, and the stair-rods are of
oak. Each principal bedroom (three in number) has its own bathroom,
completely fitted, adjoining, so that we have no washstands in the
house. The servants' bedrooms have each a lavatory basin with hot and
cold water, and a radiator. Drinking water is laid on to each bedroom.
Hot water, which is really hot, is from a furnace in the cellar, and
the central heating is worked in the same way. These furnaces work
quite smoothly, and give no trouble. We have a well-heated linen
room, which keeps linen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96"
id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> and blankets well aired, and a light and
easily handled vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p>"We have had no fire anywhere all the winter, and the temperature of
the house, hall, stairs, passages, etc., has been very steadily at 60°
Fahrenheit, day and night. During a frosty spell we keep the furnace
going a little more strongly. All the principal rooms have powerful
electric wires to enable one to boil kettles, cook, iron, etc.</p>

<p>"So far I have kept three servants, but I find they are so opposed
to all my labour-saving devices&mdash;refusing even to touch the vacuum
cleaner!&mdash;that I am parting with them, and am engaging two ladies
instead; and although the house is large enough to require six servants
if differently fitted, they and I confidently expect to run it easily
and comfortably, with plenty of time to spare for recreation."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<h4>A Labour-Saving Flat.</h4>

<p>"I live by myself and have until lately kept two servants. In
consequence, most of my income has been spent on housekeeping. I prefer
many other things to food, soap, dusters, and servants, so now I have
altered my arrangements.</p>

<p>"My flat consists of two sitting-rooms, kitchen, and three bedrooms.
The block ought, of course, to have been supplied with a constant
service of hot water for heating and cleaning, but we are behind the
times in England in these matters. So now I have gas fires in all the
rooms and a gas circulator and a gas cooker. Electric light everywhere.
I have made the third room into a box-room, dress-room, etc., and
have table, dress-stand, and machine, and a work-woman sews there one
day a week and keeps me mended and tidy, and also makes covers and
lampshades, and so on. Sometimes she comes two or even three days if I
need her, and except for tailor-mades, hats, and a good dress now and
again, she makes all I wear. I find this a great economy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
</p>

<p>"All my floors are covered with linoleum. I have weeded out
unnecessary furniture, only keeping really good pieces. I have muslin
screens made to fit the windows, so dirt does not come in, and having
no coal fires, the rooms keep extraordinarily clean. I have a fitted
bathroom and no washstand work. My breakfast I have in bed as early as
I please, and it consists of tea, a boiled egg, and jam or fruit and
toast. It is all put ready on a covered tray and I have an electric
arrangement for boiling water and making toast by my bedside. I turn
on the gas circulator and my gas fire and go back to bed and have
breakfast and read my papers and letters.</p>

<p>"By the time I want to get up my room is warm and the bath water
hot. I generally breakfast at seven, as I like to read a good deal
before getting up. My daily servant comes at eight and stays till after
lunch. She is able to clean and cook and leave my simple dinner ready,
sometimes in a hay box and sometimes put ready for me to heat. I am
seldom in to tea, and if I am it is a simple matter to prepare that
meal.</p>

<p>"I have no objection to answering my door, but if I wish to be 'Not
at home' the hall indicator proclaims that fact. The porter takes
in parcels if I ask him to do so, and cleans boots, carries<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
luggage, and gets cabs, or in these days doesn't get them! I do various
little jobs of polishing, cleaning, etc., because I like a very clean
house. In the drawing-room I have an electric fire cleverly made to
flicker like real flames. It is nice to sit with because it has the
movement that one misses. Sometimes I have a friend to stay, and if
I have friends to dine I engage a waitress and keep my out-worker
all day. I often have friends to lunch, but more often entertain
at my club. I am more comfortable than when I had two maids and my
expenses are far less. I think my two young ladies must have been very
hospitable, for my bills were decidedly high. Also they seemed to live
on soap and dusters, and to consume incredible quantities of electric
light and gas. Of course, if I had fires and coals and a kitchen range
and crowded rooms, and wanted elaborate meals, I could not manage as I
do; but as things are, I am both clean and comfortable."</p>

this closet by means of gas burners, which can be used when the large
gas boilers are not required. Hot water for a bathroom is provided by
a geyser when only one or two of the family are at home. A condensing

<h4>A Three Sitting-room, Hall, and Six Bedroom Suburban House.</h4>

<p>"I call this house suburban because it is within 'daily
bread' distance of London and therefore the neighbourhood is
much built over. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102"
id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> enables us to have electric light and
a telephone, and the London stores deliver three times a week. I was
told that servants were simply appalling, so bad and so hard to find.
So I thought we had better be as independent of them as possible. We
had taken a small house and were rearranging it, so I decided to have
a coke furnace for hot water and radiators and little electric fires
in the drawing-room and smoking-rooms, for cold weather and for the
cheering effect a fire gives. The gardener undertakes the furnace and
stokes at seven, at midday, and when he leaves at night. The house is
beautifully warm, and we have no trouble with radiators or hot water.
I have no scullery, but cook by electricity, and have a sink in the
kitchen, where there is an alcove with a table and armchairs for the
maids, and they have their own little piece of garden to sit in. There
is a pantry, and the house-parlourmaid can sit there if she wishes.
There is a buttery hatch into the dining-room, and the cook has only
to hand the dishes through it. I keep an oil stove in readiness should
the electric cooker go wrong, but so far it has not. The cook's work is
greatly lessened when cooking by electricity. We have three bathrooms
and no washhandstand bedroom work. The house has polished wood<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
floors, and rugs and linoleum. It is simply but well furnished, and I
have glass over the mahogany toilet tables, sideboard, and side tables.
Very little metal work, and the doors and woodwork are unpainted. This
saves much labour. We have a polished dinner-table and save the cost of
buying and washing tablecloths, side and toilet cloths. Unfortunately,
I had knives of the old-fashioned kind, but use a knife machine, and
long-handled mops, Bissel sweeper, etc. In normal times we entertained
a good deal, and then had a woman to help wash up; but now, of course,
there is practically no entertaining.</p>

<p class="noindent center">METER READING</p>

<p>In order to check expenditure on gas and to detect wastage, leakage,
or faulty registration, the gas-meter ought to be read regularly, say
once a week, and a record kept of the amount of gas consumed.</p>

<p>Meter reading is quite simple, and it should be no more difficult
for an educated woman to learn to read her own gas-meter than a
reasonably intelligent child to learn to tell the time by the clock.</p>

<p>The only thing to remember is that as meat is measured in "pounds"
and calico in "yards," so gas is measured in "thousands" (of cubic
feet). If, therefore, you have burned ten "thousands," and gas in your
district is, say, half-a-crown a thousand, your bill will be ten half
crowns. If gas is 3/- a thousand, then your bill will be ten times 3/-,
and so on.</p>

<p>A copy of instructions mounted on a card can always be had from the
local gas manager, and hung up in a convenient place near the gas meter
until it is mastered by constant use.</p>

<p>The meter consists of five dials. Of these the top one should be
neglected; then the figures indicated by the four lower ones should be
written down from left to right, and 00 added to the end. If the hand
is between two figures the lowest should always be written down, with
the exception that when it is between 9 and 0, 9 must be recorded. That
is all there is to do: and by this simple procedure it is possible
to find out exactly how much gas has been used during the week,
and whether it is more or less than the amount consumed during the
preceding week. If it happens to be more, then the careful housewife
will set about considering the circumstances and seeing in what points
she has failed to practice the economies suggested to her.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>"My labour-saving ideas were put to the test, for the gardener was
called up, and the cook was ill, and I could not get anyone else for
nearly a fortnight. My husband fed the furnace night and morning, and
he and I gardened (he was in London five days a week from nine till
seven). The house-parlourmaid (a capital girl), and myself, cleaned
and cooked, and by careful planning we kept the house nice, and fed
well&mdash;that is, as well as one does feed nowadays. I was able
to go on with my war work, and my maid went out often, as I do not
approve of shutting up young girls for days together. We covered up
the drawing-room and the unused bedrooms and bathroom. When you have
no coals to bother with, housework becomes a very different matter. I
put your idea of cooking mornings into practice, and found that if I
cooked three mornings a week I need do very little on the intermediate
days. Then cooking by electricity is so easy. There is no stooping to
lift things out of ovens, and the cooker can be put where you<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> want
it as regards the light, and the pots and pans don't get dirty outside.
I used earthenware, and cooked and served in one pot, and so saved
washing up. Alice, the maid, and I quite enjoyed ourselves, and we made
no trouble of stoking the furnace at midday.</p>

<p>"One thing struck me: how tiresome to servants it must be when they
see people using just as many knives and spoons and forks and plates
as they can&mdash;for I must own I began to feel rather mean about the
washing up. I think meals had become too long, and the service far
too elaborate, and the result not worth all the time and trouble it
entailed. It makes me sad to think of all the girls and women there are
who are tired to death doing work which they could be saved. I often
think of the working-class women toiling along, and having to bear and
rear babies all the time!"</p>

<h4>A Labour-Saving House in a Provincial Town.</h4>

<p>"My experiences may interest you. The family consists of myself,
husband, a girl of six, and a boy of three. I kept a nurse, cook,
house-parlourmaid, and a 'tweeny.' The wage bill was high, the
housekeeping bills, including replacements, coal and light, food and
cleaning materials, excessive, and we found it hard to get even a
fairly good cook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
</p>

<p>"Suddenly I decided to try the following plan. The house was modern
and rather well planned. Dining and drawing-room, small square hall,
kitchen and pantry on ground floor, a little garden back and front,
and a mosaic doorstep, only one step. First floor, four bedrooms and
a bathroom and dressing-room. Above, two rooms and box-room. Gas is
dear here, and electric current moderate in price, so I had electric
fires and cooker put in. There already was hot water on ground floor.
I managed to plan a service lift from outside the kitchen to first
floor.</p>

<p>"I then looked over my possessions, and put away unnecessary things
and simplified the style of living somewhat. Then I engaged a trained
lady nurse, capable of teaching the children for a year or two. The
nurse agreed to dust her nurseries, and I gave up to her a nursery,
night nursery, and the dressing-room opening into the night nursery.
The floors of all bedrooms, bathrooms, landing, top stairs, kitchen and
offices were all covered with linoleum. The nurse agreed to dust and
tidy the nurseries and take the dishes, etc., out of the lift, and to
replace them. I arranged a pantry cupboard for her and she had electric
fires and heater for food, irons, etc. The bathroom with hot and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
cold water was next door. My husband and I had the other two rooms,
and he had a bath and hand-basin fitted in the one he used for his
dressing-room. We thought it cheaper to have a gas circulator rather
than an electrical heater for the hot water, and we had a radiator
fitted in the hall and on the first landing. These keep the house so
warm that we need wonderfully little in the way of extra firing. Nurse
has everything she needs to hand, and says she prefers it to having to
ask the maids to fetch and carry for her. She has friends near, and we
can often let her go out when the babes are put to bed, as I can sit in
the drawing-room and hear at once if they call.</p>

<p>"I then dismissed my cook and 'tweeny,' as I did not like them very
much, and asked the house-parlourmaid if she would like to stay at an
increased wage if I undertook the greater part of the cooking and had
a charwoman two days a week. Our hall floor is mosaic, and there is a
little shed for the perambulator, so it does not come into the house.
We are all called by alarum clocks, and we make our early tea on the
electric heater in our room, so that the maid has no hot water or tea
to bring or calling to do. When dressed, she goes straight downstairs
and lights the gas to heat the water, does hall, dining-room and
smoking-room.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>"This is rather a clean town, and with no fires the rooms do not get
dirty, and are quickly swept and dusted, and of course there are no
coal boxes to fill or carry, and no grates to do. We find the doorstep
only needs doing three times a week, except in very dirty weather, and
there is no polished metal on the door. We have a simple breakfast
of porridge (cooked the day before), toast, done on our own electric
toaster on the table, fresh and crisp and hot. We make our own tea
and coffee, and boil eggs if needed, and very often have a cold dish,
but about three times a week the maid cooks bacon, or fish, or eggs.
My husband goes off to work after breakfast, and is seldom home till
six. The maid cleans boots, and we have the new washable knives. I
clear breakfast things and wash them up, tidy the flowers and see to
plants, etc., and set to work at my cooking. I follow the plan you
once suggested, and have three cooking mornings. It is wonderful with
practice what you get through, washing up as you go and never getting
into a muddle. On the other days the cooking<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> seldom takes me more
than an hour. Two mornings a week I housekeep, doing accounts,
shopping, etc., and on one I clean silver. We breakfast at eight and
lunch at 1.30, so I get a long morning. The maid has all morning for
housework, and nurse helps her make the beds. We wait on ourselves
at lunch, and nurse and the children come down. After lunch the maid
clears and washes up and tidies the kitchen. Nurse gets and washes
up the nursery tea, and if I am in and alone I have it with her. I
don't expect any washing or mending done by the general servant, as I
consider she should have two hours' free time in the afternoon. Our
dinner is very simple&mdash;three things, such as soup or fish, meat
or bird, sweet, savoury or cheese. The charwoman cleans kitchen, back
doorstep, pantry, passage, and hall; washes out rubbers and odds and
ends, and washes up and tidies after dinner. My maid has her family
near, so she goes out two evenings a week from half-past five to a
quarter to ten, and the charwoman stays here till 8.30 on those days.
It suits her to come to me at eleven o'clock, and I pay her 3s. instead
of 2s. 6d. as she stays late, and of course she gets her supper. I have
fitted her out with dress and aprons. She won't wear a cap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115"
id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed, we manage most comfortably, and the saving is great. I
cook well, and make the best of all we have, and the economy in gas
and light and cleaning things and breakages is considerable. Our nice
maid, Ethel, is quite one of the family, and says that getting out on
Sundays, Tuesdays, and Fridays, 'there is always something to look
forward to.' In winter I consider she should go out by daylight, so I
often send her off early on the charwoman's day. If I went away from
home I should engage a temporary cook, and if we wanted to have a
party I should have a cook by the day, and a waitress. I work at a war
depot every day, and often have my tea there. But even after the war I
doubt if I shall alter my ways, provided I remain in good health, for
I cannot see why it should be <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">infra dig.</i>
to work in one's own house when it is absolutely 'the thing' to be a
general servant or kitchenmaid in a hospital or canteen."</p>

Experiences of Labour-Saving Homes</span> (<i>Continued</i>)</p></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>For many a year I have thought that the average good domesticated
woman wasted far too much of her own time and that of her servants in
housekeeping, while, on the other hand, many women give too little time
and attention to their households.</p>

<p>Clever organisation will do much to lighten the work of a
household. Take, for example, the ordering of meals and the cooking
thereof. The average mistress orders the meals each day with no
regard except for the needs of that special day, and the average cook
cooks in just the same short-sighted manner. Now, I hold that in a
well-regulated establishment, with an intelligent cook, it should
not be necessary to order the meals more than three times a week,
unless special entertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120"
id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> has to be considered. The mistress
knows the number of her household, and can calculate with sufficient
nicety what can be done with the available material, while the cook
should be able to make the most of the various odds and ends which can
be utilised for breakfast dishes, savouries, servants' supper, and so
forth.</p>

<p>Where an inexperienced or otherwise unsatisfactory cook reigns, then
a brief daily inspection of larder and back premises in general may be
necessary; but still all the main part of the planning and ordering can
be done twice or three times a week.</p>

<p>In this book I do not wish to deal specially with war conditions,
so let us take, for example, a well-to-do country household of four
persons (husband, wife, two children) and five servants, cook,
between-maid, housemaid, parlourmaid, and nurse. In such a case the
maids are, as a rule, experienced, and the cook a woman who receives
anything between £26 and £35 a year.</p>

<p>There is generally a guest staying in the house, and a couple of
people to lunch on Sunday, various friends to tea, and probably two
or three more friends to lunch during the week. The mistress of this
house elects to have housekeeping mornings on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday, though, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121"
id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> course, it is understood that she will
visit the back premises on any other mornings if it is advisable to do
so.</p>

<p>On Monday the contents of the larder are as follows: Piece of cold
roast ribs of beef, remains of two boiled chickens, half a ham, half a
cold fruit tart, some lemon sponge, some potted meat, and part of a tin
of sardines.</p>

<p>Now, meat should always be ordered in advance so that the butcher
may have it properly hung. If the larder is not very good the butcher
will keep the meat until the day on which it is needed, otherwise
a joint should always be hanging in the larder, and in this case a
<a id="corr3"></a>forequarter of lamb has been in the house since
Saturday.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, of course, for the mistress to write directions
as to the stock to be used for this or that soup, etc. These details I
have added for the use of the inexperienced reader.</p>

<p>When a dish is queried it means that the cook must use her own
discretion as to whether there is enough chicken, or whatever
it may be, or if she must substitute some other

<p>The object of ordering in this fashion is that it saves the time of
both mistress and cook, the tradesmen's orders can be given in advance,
and the cook can arrange her work to the best<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> advantage. The butcher
should have his orders weekly, if possible, and the fish order will
probably be sent by post or rail, the keeper of the poultry yard can be
warned of what will be needed from his department also, and so muddle
and fluster is discouraged throughout the establishment. In a town
household I have practised this method with success also, and recommend
it to any busy woman, while I have never yet known a cook who did not
appreciate it when once she had given it a trial.</p>

<p>In towns, because the shops are so near, cooks are far too liable
to leave everything to the last minute, and the mistresses' telephone
bell and the unfortunate tradesmen's boys and horses suffer greatly in
consequence, or the time of the kitchen underling is wasted in "just
running out" to get something which should have been ordered the day
before.</p>

<p>In houses where the cook is inexperienced, and food is bought in far
smaller quantities, the daily visit to the kitchen becomes necessary
partly because the mistress must see that the premises are kept clean
each day, and partly because the cook may not realise how to make the
best of the "pieces."</p>

<p>Half the secret of catering well on a small<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> allowance lies in
knowing how to use pieces, and of taking advantage from day to day of
fluctuations in price, which latter cannot be done in the same way when
standing orders must be given.</p>

<p>Even in tiny households, however, the mistress may do much to
lighten the labour of the cook, and to save expense both of coal and
material by planning her bills of fare with care, and showing her cook
how she may prepare in one morning various items which will come in
during the next two days, when perhaps there will be less time to spare
for culinary efforts owing to the necessity for turning out a room,
cleaning the kitchen, or washing.</p>

<p>The example given is that of a good-sized country house; but in town
it is possible to shop personally and take advantage of the state of
the market. Even so, three housekeeping and two shopping days should
suffice. Perishable odds and ends can be bought when going out on other
business.</p>

<p>These methodical methods answer well in several small households
known to me, where the mistresses are women busy over social work, or
who have professions.</p>

<p>One clever manager sends me the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<h4>Cooking in Advance.&mdash;An Interesting Letter.</h4>

<p>"In these days, when so many women are managing with a smaller
domestic staff than usual, and often doing much of the actual work
themselves, they might try the experiment with advantage of 'cooking
mornings,' a plan already mentioned several times by you. It is a
method which makes for efficiency and better results with less work.</p>

<p>"In the first place, to give up the whole of Friday morning and a
couple of hours on Tuesday to the preparation of food alone, means that
one has not to leave the housework or sewing on other days to mix one
odd dish or so, thereby effecting a certain saving of time; secondly,
much less fuel is used than would have been required to heat the stove
for the same number of dishes prepared separately; thirdly, the labour
of washing up and cleaning culinary utensils is much reduced. A really
good manager can always plan the meals well for several days ahead, so
if provisions and stores are ordered in beforehand, that again is far
better than constant daily marketing for small supplies.</p>

<p>"My personal plan, which answers very well, is to sketch out menus
roughly, order meat, etc., on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128"
id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> Thursday, and prepare <em>so far as I can</em>
on Friday, something after this fashion.</p>

<p>"The range, being well heated, will cook both in the oven and on the
top as fast as I can get things ready, and I can usually make two sorts
of soup (two meals' supply in each), a milk soup for immediate use, and
a vegetable, lentil, or haricot purée which will keep a day or two;
then any remains of meat, game, or ham are minced and used to stuff
tomatoes, onions, or potatoes, and put aside for breakfast or lunch
dishes; fish is flaked and made into rissoles or a pie; beef steak or
shin of beef, cutlets or rabbit or a pigeon can be prepared and cooked
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en casserole</i> ready for reheating when required; a cold dish for
Sunday supper, which will come in also for breakfast or lunch, such as
a small meat mould, or a beef galantine is prepared; next, a batch of
scones, which keep well in a tin, and some rock cakes or a plain ginger
loaf or sultana cake (for present use), and either a good chocolate or
cherry cake or some little fancy 'petits fours,' which will be ready
in case of emergency, and, if not required earlier, will be just as
good towards the end of the week.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p> <p>"Sweets are the
next thing, and usually four or five are arranged for. A good batch
of pastry may be made, say a fruit tart, one or two fancy ones, such
as Bakewell, treacle, or custard, some little jam puffs or lemon
cheesecakes or 'maids-of-honour,' which keep splendidly; in this case
a meat pie (steak and kidney, rabbit, or veal and ham) would be made
instead of the cold meat dish. On alternate weeks, or if pastry is not
wished for, the sweets take some such form as a Swiss roll, a batch
of castle puddings, French pancakes (all of which will keep in the
invaluable air-tight tin), with a rice meringue or rice, cream and
fruit for Saturday, and a boiled suet pudding of some sort (ginger,
treacle, or lemon), or a steamed sponge pudding for Friday's dinner.</p>

<p>"Now work this out and see what a well-supplied larder you can
rejoice over, and how little cooking you have to do the next three
days. Then when Tuesday comes, utilise any remains of Sunday's joint,

develop more soup out of the stock which will by now have accumulated,

may count on two more days clear for the many other tasks which fall
to a good housekeeper's lot, and also for the most necessary free time

<h3>II</h3>

<h4>The Late-Dinner Bogey.</h4>

<p>"For a long time it was the late-dinner bogey which caused us to
keep more servants than we needed, and to live expensively and rather
uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"At last my husband's dislike of cooks became so passionate (and not
without reason), that I determined to change my household arrangements,
arguing that we could scarcely have worse food than we were having
already. My husband, I must explain, is one of those men who cannot
eat a heavy lunch and work after it, so he needs a hot and substantial
dinner. How was this to be arranged with only one servant who went out
twice a week, and a wife who only wished to cook in the morning?</p>

<p>"Well, we managed thus. We bought a neat electrical heater for the
dining-room, and put the hot dishes ready on it and all the cold things
on the sideboard. Then when dinner was announced, the maid waited, and
as she never had to leave the room, she managed well, even when we had
friends to dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134"
id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"After all, in restaurants food is not cooked just for you, it is
prepared and finished or kept hot in hot cupboards or on hot plates.
Managing as we now do our hot food is always hot, and the saving in
wages, upkeep and food considerable. On Sunday night we have supper
with hot soup, and on the other nights I choose such a menu as soup,
stewed oxtail with carrot and turnip, potato cake, cold sweet or
cheese, celery, etc. Coffee (if we need it) we make in an apparatus in
the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Of course, we had to have a labour-saving house, otherwise I could
not have done the work with one servant and a nurse."</p>

<p>The writer of this letter uses an electric heater, but in a "gas
house" the "Utility" gas ring with hot plate would take its place.</p>

<p>An illustrated booklet and price list of this excellent contrivance
may be obtained from the Gas, Light and Coke Company, Horseferry Road,

<h4>A Letter from a Professional Woman who does her own <a id="corr4">
</a>Housework.</h4>

<p>"In reply to your letter, I will describe my domestic methods. You
can testify, can you not, that my little flat is well-kept and that the
meals are nicely served?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135"
id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"As you know, the flat consists of sitting-room, bedroom, bathroom,
tiny kitchen, linen cupboard and box cupboard, and a cupboard in which
I keep all cleaning utensils.</p>

<p>"In the bathroom is a fitted basin, so I have not even a washstand
in my bedroom. The kitchen sink and bathroom are served by one gas
geyser, and I have gas fires and a gas cooker. I should like a coal
fire in the drawing-room, but it would make too much work. There is
electric light.</p>

<p>"There is an 'in' and 'out' indicator in the hall, and a little box
under it for my cards and notes.</p>

<p>"My floors throughout the flat are covered with a soft, streaked,
green linoleum (not the plain, as that shows every mark). My
dining-room table (just large enough for four) is round, and folds
flat against the wall in the hall when not in use. I have rugs which
I can go over with my Bissel sweeper, or with my Good Housewife
suction cleaner. I use the latter for the chairs, sofa, mattresses,
and curtains. The linoleum I dust and polish with long-handled mops,
and as I object to crawling about on hands and knees, I have a special
long-handled mop and pail with wringer attached for washing floors
and a long-handled scrubber for the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> and hall. But when you
do your own housework, and have no coal, it is wonderful how clean
things keep. My knives are stainless steel and need no polishing. I
have glass rather than silver, and fireproof china ware in which I cook
and serve the food. I have no polished metal, and I use newspapers for
most purposes for which other people use cloths. I never dry plates and
cups, but just put them in a rack to dry.</p>

<p>"My rooms are rather empty, but what is in them is really good.</p>

<p>"My day is arranged thus. Foreign-fashion breakfast, put ready over
night on a tray (covered), with coffee and milk ready mixed. This I
heat. I light the geyser, and while the water heats have my breakfast
in bed. In cold weather I can switch on my bedroom fire from my bed,
and as my gas-ring has a long tube, heat my coffee without getting out
of bed if I please.</p>

<p>"After breakfast I get up and put on an overall instead of my dress.
With no fires and no washstand work and my long-handled cleaners the
work is quickly done. I prepare what I need for lunch and dinner; food
is so simple a matter when you live alone: my lunch, for example,
is generally milk pudding, cheese and fruit, and my dinner of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> two
courses, meat or fish and sweet or cheese, and often I buy cooked food
if I am very busy.</p>

<p>"I work from eleven until three or four. Then I go out and generally
have tea with friends or at my club.</p>

<p>"I come in, dine, tidy up, put breakfast ready, and often work for
an hour or two, or read, and go to bed.</p>

<p>"I give up Friday to special turning out and cleaning, mending,
etc.</p>

<p>"My entertaining consists of tea or dinner (not more than four).
Then I have a waitress who clears away and washes up. For such dinners
I have soup, fish au gratin, stewed pigeons with savoury rice, or
chicken en casserole, potato croquettes, cold sweet, cheese, coffee,
dessert. The kind of dinner which can all be put ready for the waitress
down to the last detail.</p>

<p>"I should detest to exist in a squalid muddle, but really it is
not necessary to do so. Living as I do I can save money. If I kept a
servant I should spend all I earn and be no more comfortable."</p>


<h4>About Washing Up.</h4>

<p>"I wonder if ladies who do their own work realise that it is
possible to wash up and still keep one's<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> hands nice by using
rubber gloves and different sized mops. When I began to do my own work
for a family of husband and four children I had great trouble with my
nails splitting. Now my hands are as nice as ever they were. I have
three mops of different sizes, one with a brush on the back for hard
rubbing. I wear a rubber glove on my left hand (they cost 1s. 3d. a
pair, and I have had one pair for months) and use the water practically
boiling, as one can tilt up plates, etc., out of the water with the
mop, and plates slipped into a rack will then require no drying. My
saucepan brush has a long handle and the wire bristles are put in on
the slant. I can wash up after any meal without wetting one finger.
I have an old skewer stuck in the woodwork beside the sink, and on
to it I slip the glove to dry between washings up. I have found it a
great saving of time and trouble, too, to have long-handled sweeping
brushes, and I have ordered a long-handled hard scrubbing brush, mop,
and wringer, so that I can do the scullery and kitchen, etc., without
getting down on my knees or putting my hands in water."</p>

<p class="center noindent"><span class="smcap">Coal, Coke, and Gas: How
to Use Them to the Best Advantage</span></p></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Of all labour-saving forces at present available, I think we must
regard electricity and gas as the most important.</p>

<p>Often, however, it is not for us to choose which we will employ. We
must needs use gas if electric current is not available, and we must
count the cost of both before deciding whether or no we may employ
either.</p>


<h4>Counting the Cost.</h4>

<p>Counting the cost is not so simple a matter as it seems, for it
does not suffice to ascertain the price of gas per 1000 feet, and of
electricity per unit, and of coal and coke per ton, and of wood per 100
bundles, because you have also to ascertain what you can save in labour
and in other items before you can arrive at any just conclusion.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that you decide to build a house and warm it by hot
water, to light it and to cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142"
id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> by gas or electricity. In that case you
could save the cost of grates, chimneys, the kitchen range, fenders,
fireirons, coal boxes, chimney sweeping, a considerable amount of
cleaning, and the labour of the people who would be needed to handle
the coal and do the cleaning.</p>

<p>So you must consider the matter carefully, not forgetting that it
is further complicated by the fact that you may find it difficult to
obtain servants, and that it might pay you to use gas or electricity
even though coal was cheaper, because of the scarcity and high cost
of labour. You have also to consider that the cost of coal, gas, and
electricity depend to some extent on the people who use them. One
cook, for example, will burn nearly double the coal burned by another
and obtain no better result. It is the same with gas and electric
current.</p>

<h4>The Coke Furnace.</h4>

<p>Now, taking into account the fact that no water company has yet been
sufficiently enterprising to provide a supply of hot water, I think the
cheapest and most labour-saving method of warming houses and providing
hot water is by means of a coke furnace or possibly two furnaces.
These should heat all the radiators and supply all hot water.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> My
personal experience of a coke furnace is that it needs but little
attention, and that coke is light, clean, and easy to handle as
compared with coal. These furnaces do, however, need some coal to light
them. The procedure is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  </div>
</div>


<h4>How to Light a Coke Furnace.</h4>

<p>First thing in the morning, rake out the furnace and keep the
clinker (burnt coke). Put in paper, some sticks, and a shovelful of
coal. Light. When burning up add some fresh coke. When well alight,
and the water hot, add more coke mixed with clinkers. If the water is
quite cold it takes some fifty minutes to get it really hot, though a
warm bath would be ready in thirty minutes. If, however, the furnace
is banked at night, the water would still be warm at 6.30 in the
morning.</p>

<p>In my own house, we need three hot baths before the 8.30 breakfast,
and the furnace must be lighted by 6.30 to 6.40 to obtain them. If the
cook comes down late she uses more coal to get the furnace burning
quickly. After breakfast the cook feeds the furnace with a little more
coke, the rubbish and some more coke on top. Rubbish should not be put
in unless the fire is fairly hot. The furnace heats a large radiator,
water for two bathrooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144"
id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> two sinks, and three hand-basins. In
winter, the furnace is banked up after lunch, and not made up again
until before dinner, and the supply of hot water is constant, and there
can be hot baths at night if needed; but if all the hot water is run
off at night and the furnace is not made up again it naturally takes
longer to heat the water in the morning. In summer the furnace is let
out after the rubbish is burned; and with a small household the water
for washing up is heated on the gas.</p>

<p>One cook who came down late used far too much coal to light the
furnace (which is bad for it, as it fouls the flue with soot), threw
away all clinkers, and would not burn rubbish, and therefore consumed
quite one-third more coke than the present cook, and obtained no better
result.</p>

<p>Still, all things considered, I know no better or more economical
method of heating the rooms and providing hot water in a household of
any size than the coke furnace. This I should not say were gas and
electricity cheaper, because, of course, a water heater which is set
going by turning a tap or switch is obviously more labour-saving than a
furnace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145"
id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>In almost all households gas or electric heaters are practical,
because if used carefully they are not too expensive, and in small
houses or flats where the mistress is her own maid, or depends upon
help from a visiting worker, I should certainly recommend the abolition
of either coke or coal from the labour-saving point of view alone.</p>

<h4>Some Figures.</h4>

<p>I find that in the two years we have used the furnace we have
consumed 120 sacks of coke, but part of it was mixed with the coal
burned in the drawing-room. I must also admit that during part of this
time the fuel was carelessly used. In addition to the coke burned in
the furnace, coal was needed for lighting it. We used nine tons of
coal in two years, for the drawing-room fire (a large old-fashioned,
extravagant grate) and for the furnace. These were partly war years,
and coal cost on an average 35s. a ton, and the coke 1s. 2d. a sack;
roughly £11 10s. for furnace and drawing-room fire per year. In
addition, the gas bills for two years have been, for cooker and five
fires (one of the latter lighted in dining-room for about three hours
a day, another burned a good deal in Christmas holidays, fire in
servants' hall used in the afternoon in cold weather, and two bedroom
fires only for an hour or two in the evening<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> when <em>very</em> cold, except
during a three-weeks' illness, and one or two days when people had
colds), about £40. Gas is at the war price (in London) 3s. per 1,000
feet, and (for "war reasons") inferior in quality to what it was before
the war, and the figure includes meter and stove rent (two stoves,
kitchen, and servants' hall).</p>

<p>When considering these sums it must be remembered that this is a
small London house, and that the furnace in the kitchen heats that
and keeps the smoking-room above from ever being very cold. The large
radiator in the hall, heated from the furnace, makes an enormous
difference to the warmth of the house; also the drawing-room fire was
not lighted in the morning except in really cold weather. To the coal,
coke, and gas bills must be added 14s. worth of wood during the two
years. Old boxes were chopped up, so that if all the wood had been
bought it might have amounted to 18s. or £1, say £32 10 0 for a year's
fuel.</p>

<p>Had we used a coal range and coal fires and had no radiator, I
calculate that the cost of coal would amount to at least £35, and that
we should have used more wood, and certainly we could not have run the
house without more help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147"
id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p><b>When counting the cost of heating, lighting, and cooking, allow
for expert's figures. The average servant, and for that matter, the
average mistress, is not an expert, and until she is, will not be able
to obtain the best value for the money spent as does the expert.</b></p>

<p>In another household known to me, the furnace is larger and more
coke is used, and it is made up at about seven o'clock, at midday,
and again at night. This furnace heats water for two bathrooms, three
sinks, four hand-basins, and radiators all over the house. The house is
always beautifully warm, and only a small fire "for company" is needed
in the drawing-room. In this house there is a coal range for cooking,
but in hot weather an oil stove is used. The quantities of fuel used
are for two years: 13 tons coal, 18 tons coke, 8 tons anthracite, 234
gallons of oil.</p>

<p>In a maisonette of three floors, gas is used for cooking and for
water heating and nursery ironing ring, and coal for dining-room fire,
drawing-room in late afternoon and evening, and nursery when necessary.
(Child goes to a kindergarten.) The cost for coal and gas for the year
1915 was £28 10s. In flats where the bathroom is near the furnace less
fuel is needed.</p>

<p>In all of the three cases mentioned the labour bill would have
had to be increased had coal been in<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> use everywhere.
Furthermore, a gas expert tells me that with more careful use the bills
could be reduced; but as one is seldom able to secure the services
of experts, allowance must be made for careless usage of fuel when
counting the cost.</p>

</div>


<h4>The Use of Gas.</h4>

<p>Let us deal now with the question of gas, and suppose that the hot
water is provided by a gas circulator, that it is, for various reasons,
not feasible to put in radiators, and that a gas cooker and gas fires
are used.</p>

<p>There are various kinds of circulators, rubbish destructors, cookers
and fires, and so great has been the improvement in their mechanism
and appearance that I really do not think any objection on the score
of health or appearance can be made now to the use of gas. One
disadvantage is, possibly, that some of the best and most modern fires
and cookers cannot be hired. Still, one does not hire one's fireplaces
and coal ranges, so why do we always expect to obtain gas fires and
cookers on hire?</p>

<p>Some fires I have lately seen were really attractive, and would not
spoil the effect of any room.</p>

<p>Readers of this book who wish to see what can be done for them by
means of gas should visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149"
id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> the showrooms of the various gas
companies, and especially those of Messrs. Davis, 60, Oxford Street,
W.</p>


<h4>Good Advice.</h4>

<p>Before deciding on any special fires, stoves, etc., the customer
should ask the gas company to inspect the premises and to give advice
as to the best method of dealing with that particular house or flat,
because the choice of apparatus must depend on the situation of the
boiler, the length of pipes needed, the height of the house, the
position of the bathroom, and the kind of grates available.</p>

<p>In some houses it would be out of the question to heat water by gas,
in others it would be possible and even economical.</p>

<p>But I regret to have to say that the gas companies do not always
seem to have employees capable of giving the best advice. In London,
the Gas Light and Coke Company have a clever staff, amongst whom are
several ladies known as the Women's Advisory Staff. These ladies
are extremely helpful, and when they have talked the matter over
with the prospective customer, will call in experts who deal with
the questions of cost, of fitting, etc. Two heads are better than
one, and therefore I always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150"
id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> advise the would-be gas-user to pick the
brains of one of these ladies (who are trained cooks as well as gas
experts), as well as those of the male staff.</p>

<p>When the cookers and fires have been installed a lady will then
call, free of charge, and demonstrate the use of the various apparatus,
and it can also be arranged that the fires, cooker, etc., are inspected
and kept in order for a nominal sum per annum.</p>


<h4>Gas for Water Heating.</h4>

<p>Regarding the use of gas for water heating, it would be useless for
me to go into details, for only an expert who has seen the house can
know how best to deal with the matter, and whether to advise the use
of geysers, califonts, hydrotherms, etc.; or whether gas circulators
should be ruled out and a coke furnace substituted. Excluding the cost
of installation, and under suitable circumstances, it is estimated that
a large hot bath costs rather less than twopence, and one less full
and not quite so hot, rather more than one penny. The cost must vary a
little, as in summer time the temperature of the water before heating
is higher than in winter, also the size of baths varies.</p>

<p>When using gas for heating, the baths and fitted basins should
not be unnecessarily large, and note<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> that a square-bottomed
bath will need more water to fill it than that which is curved. Do not
forget that every pint of hot water costs something to make it hot.</p>

<p>Many improvements have been made in geysers of late, and they are
now as fool-proof as any apparatus can be. But when one has to deal
with a girl who will turn on the gas in the oven and forget that she
has not lighted it, shut the door, and then, when the house reeks of
gas, arm herself with a lighted taper and start looking for the escape,
it is difficult to estimate against what depth of human folly the gas
apparatus must be made immune.</p>

<p>Geysers are now contrived so that the one apparatus will serve
several taps, and circulators are fitted with concentric burners, so
that when the water is hot the ring is put out and only the small inner
burner used.</p>

<p>Thermostats are fixed to reduce automatically the consumption of gas
directly the water reaches a certain temperature.</p>

<p>A cut-out system is also applied to existing cylinders and tanks of
unnecessarily large size.</p>

<p>When using a gas circulator the gas should be turned out when hot
water is not required&mdash;a detail which many people forget.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152"
id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>For example, one servant heats the water for baths, washing up and
cleaning, then the gas is put out after lunch, and is not lighted again
until hot water is wanted at night. Another keeps the gas burning the
whole day.</p>


<h4>Gas for Lighting.</h4>

<p>When electricity is available, I should not choose gas as an
illuminant, but when it must be employed it is now so arranged and
shaded that the effect is perfect and the blacking of walls and ceiling
reduced to a minimum. It may surprise some of my readers to know that
gas can now be fitted so that it is switched on and off from a wall
switch in the same fashion as electricity. Incandescent burners make
for economy, and now <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijou</i> burners are to be had suitable for small
rooms, offices, etc., which consume less than the large burners.
Allowing for gas at 3s. per 1000 feet, one large incandescent burner
costs one penny every eight hours, a medium burner one penny for every
twelve hours, and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijou</i> one penny for every eighteen hours.</p>


<h4>Gas Fires.</h4>

<p>When choosing a gas fire see that there is a duplex burner,
so that two or three jets can be turned out, leaving the centre
jets burning. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153"
id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> the room is warm the smaller fire
will suffice to keep it so. The best modern fires are noiseless and
ventilated beautifully, and, as I have already said, they are really
pleasing in appearance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do not advise a gas fire, however good, as an
economy in a room which is used for hours at a time. The cost of an
average fire is said to be 1&frac14;d. per hour, counting gas at 3s. per
1000 feet, and it does not pay to burn 1&frac14;d. worth of gas per hour
for fourteen or fifteen hours at a stretch. From the point of view of
money-saving it would be cheaper to burn coal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, supposing a gas fire is lighted in a sitting-room
in the morning, it can be turned out if the family are out in the
afternoon, and not relighted until shortly before they return, for
the advantage of gas and electric fires is that they are red-hot
practically at once, whereas a coal fire takes time to burn up and
become hot, and each time it is lighted it eats wood as well as
coal.</p>

<p>Still, say what one will, a coal or wood fire is pleasanter to sit
with, and for that reason, unless I were quite servantless, I would
have one "live" fire in the house. Expert advice must be obtained when
putting in gas fires in order to be sure that<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> the kind most suitable
is obtained, and the ventilation must be carefully attended to.</p>

<p>People often say, "Oh, I couldn't sit in a room with a gas fire,"
having no experience of a well-made, well-ventilated, and properly
fitted fire.</p>

<p>There are old-fashioned, badly fitted gas fires which deserve every
evil thing which can be said of them; but again there are many others:
there is even a fire which can be set alight by turning a switch at
your bedside, so that you do not set foot out of that warm refuge until
the temperature of the room has become pleasant to your lightly clad
form.</p>


<h4>Gas Cookers.</h4>

<p>When choosing a gas cooker there are many points to consider, and
I own that to my mind the ideal cooker has not yet been put upon the
market. It is, however, bound to come, and gas cookers, unlike ranges,
are easily changed.</p>

<p>The cooker should have a solid hot plate,<a name="FNanchor_2_2"
id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and not an open top, but if this make cannot be obtained, a sheet of
iron covering two-thirds of the top of the cooker can be laid on it.
One gas burner will heat this, and several pans will simmer on it at
the cost of one burner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155"
id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The ordinary cooker is generally fitted with one simmering burner
and about three boiling burners, which is wrong, for to one dish
which needs boiling for more than a few minutes, at all events,
many need to simmer.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The great fault of
English cooks is that they cook everything too fast, and the average
gas stove does not discourage this naughty practice.</p>

<p>Still, this difficulty can be overcome by using the makeshift
hot-plate as already described.</p>

<p>In addition to the boiling burners there should be a griller, which
is used for browning and toasting, as well as grilling.</p>

<p>The size of the cooker must depend upon the amount of cooking
needed, but it is no economy to have a very small one, because when
the oven is in use it should be employed for almost everything. The
average cook bakes a milk pudding in the oven<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> and cooks vegetables and
hashed mutton and stewed fruit each on a boiling tap, and probably uses
the griller as well, and wonders why the gas bills are so high.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>When planning out the bills of fare the cook must use more brains
and less gas.</p>

<p>For instance, let us say that she wants to serve hashed mutton (and
Heaven help that it may not be that grey and slimy mass endured in too
many an English home!), potatoes, Brussels-sprouts, milk pudding, and
stewed fruit.</p>

<p>Let her heat the oven and cook the mutton in a casserole. The
potatoes and sprouts can cook in the oven just as well as over a
boiling tap, the milk pudding is baked, and the fruit baked in a
covered casserole. Managing thus, all the dishes are cooked in the
oven.</p>

<p>Then there will come a day when the oven need not be used at all,
and the meal be cooked on the top of the stove. After all, cooking is
carried out by heat, and it matters little in most cases if the heat
surrounds the pan as in the oven, or is kept directly under it as by a
tap.</p>

<p>Every oven should be supplied with a solid browning shelf, not a
thing with holes in it. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160"
id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> can be placed where needed, and by its
use the part of the oven above it can be kept 100 degrees cooler than
that which is below.</p>

<h4>The Cost of Cooking by Gas.</h4>

<p>A moderate-sized oven, such as would be needed in a household of not
over eight persons, burns about 30 feet of gas per hour when full on.
Of that, 10 feet will be required to heat the oven, allowing twenty
minutes for that operation. Then the gas should be turned down so that
it burns at the rate of 15 feet per hour. Ten minutes later it is
turned down again and consumes 10 feet. Thus if you use the oven for
one and a half hours it should consume 22&frac12; feet of gas.</p>

<p>In the oven you should find two open grid shelves, a solid shelf,
and a drip tin. The drip tin must be kept at the bottom of the stove
below the gas flames. The dripping falls into this and does not become
brown as it would do if the tin was placed over the flames. The drip
tin must be kept in its place, as otherwise too much air would enter
from beneath the oven and stop the cooking.</p>

<p>If, instead of hanging the meat from a hook in the oven, it is baked
on a tin, use a double baking tin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161"
id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>When roasting or baking meat, use the upper grid shelf for pastry,
and place milk pudding or some other food needing slow cooking above
the solid shelf, and then make the very best use of your oven while it
is hot. See "Cooking Mornings," p. <a href="#Page_127">127</a>.</p>

<p>The temperature of the oven to begin with, for most cakes, should be
280 degrees, for meat 300 degrees, for pastry and bread 340 degrees. An
oven thermometer can be procured, and is a great help to inexperienced
cooks. Quartern loaves take some three-quarters of an hour to bake, and
use about 25 feet of gas.</p>

<p>Large boiling burners, full on, eat about 24 feet of gas per hour.
In using boiling burners there is often great waste, as people will
turn them full on and have the flames flaring up the sides of the pan,
which is a waste of heat and causes a smell of gas. The flame should be
kept right underneath the pan or kettle.</p>

<p>The simmering taps consume about 8 feet of gas per hour, and a
clever person will, by using a three or four-tier pan, cook several
dishes at the cost of about 16 feet of gas per hour, allowing for
heating over a boiling tap at first and then simmering for the
remainder of the time.</p>

<p>The griller uses as much gas as the oven per hour;<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> but
then, of course, grilling is a quick operation. When using the grill,
make it red-hot and see that the grill pan is under, and getting hot at
the same time. The grill is used for toasting, and if you turn over the
toasted side of bread on to a cold surface, it makes it tough.</p>

<p>When the grill is hot, turn the gas down and watch the toast very
carefully, as it cooks very quickly. Always keep a large pan or kettle
of water over the griller, as it helps to throw down the heat. Do
not boil the kettle on a boiling tap and use the griller for toast,
but cook over the griller as well as under it; and this applies when
grilling chops, steak, bacon, sausages, etc., for the saucepans can
heat over the griller as well as over a tap.</p>

<p>On a modern stove, the grill is arranged so that half of it may be
lighted at a time for grilling small things. When grilling meat or
fish, cook with full heat for two minutes in order to seal the pores
and conserve the good of the food, then reduce the heat, turn, increase
the heat, and decrease again.</p>

<p>Thin steak needs about 12 minutes' cooking; thicker, 12 to 20
minutes; chops, 10 to 12 minutes; cutlets, 6 minutes; and bacon 1 or 2
minutes.</p>

<p>Pancakes can be cooked by means of the griller first over the grill
and then by placing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163"
id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> pan under it, and omelettes can be made
in the same way without turning them.</p>

<p>If the oven is not in use, milk puddings, macaroni cheese, etc., may
be cooked on a boiling tap and browned under the griller.</p>

<h4>Utensils for Gas Cookers.</h4>

<p>It is most important when cooking by gas to choose the right kind of
utensils. They should be thin and wide, rather than deep. A deep kettle
takes longer to boil and therefore costs more to boil than a shallow
one.</p>

<p>Block tin, enamel ware and earthenware casseroles and fireproof
china should be used; the two latter whenever possible, because by
cooking and serving in one dish you save labour in washing up and
generally have the food served hotter. Also food cooked in earthenware
tastes better than that cooked in metal pans.</p>

<p>Both cooker and utensils must be kept clean, for dirt, especially
soot, is a non-conductor of heat. They must also be dry. I have seen
cooks rinse out a pan and put it on the gas wet, forgetting that heat
is then wasted in drying the moisture on the outside of the pan.</p>

<p>In the same way they will boil one quart of water<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> when
they only need a pint, and waste gas in that way.</p>

<h4>To Clean a Gas Stove.</h4>

<p>A gas cooker is easily cleaned, and should be well washed with hot
water and a little soda, loose parts and oven too. Grease should be
rubbed off with newspaper as quickly as possible. The black part of the
stove is cleaned with enameline and the bright steel with very fine
emery-paper and oil, and then polished with a soft rag, or if plated
with a leather only.</p>

<p>The best kind of stove is mounted as high as possible so that it may
be cleaned underneath. Also it should be set high to avoid fatigue in
bending and lifting when using the oven, but not so high that the cook
cannot use the hot plate comfortably.</p>

<p>Be sure that no taps are clogged with grease, and remember that
when a gas stove smells it is because it is dirty or because the gas
is turned on too full and is not being properly consumed, or gas is
escaping. Well-managed gas cookers do not smell.</p>

<p>Now and then something may go wrong outside the cook's control, and
then the Gas Company must send some one to put it right.</p>

<p>But when cookers are intelligently used they<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
seldom need attention, and if it should become necessary to change
them, they are moved without much trouble or any structural work or
dirt-making.</p>


<h4>The Destruction of Rubbish.</h4>

<p>In a household where coal and coke are not used, and in places where
the unsanitary habit of collecting refuse but once a week prevails, the
careful housewife will ask, what am I to do with the rubbish? I could
burn some of it in a coal range, and most of it in a coke furnace, but
if I employ gas only, what is to become of it?</p>

<p>The only thing then is to add a gas refuse destructor to your
apparatus. In one household known to me (a London flat) there is a gas
cooker, water circulator, stove for warming the kitchen when the cooker
is not in use, and the neatest little rubbish destructor&mdash;all
fitted into a surprisingly small space.</p>


<h4>Warming the Kitchen.</h4>

<p>The mere word "kitchen" suggests warmth, but the mistress who
uses gas must not forget that when the cooker is not in use (which
may often be from 1.30 to 6 or 6.30 in the evening, except for the
boiling of a kettle), and if the circulator is also turned out,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> the
kitchen would probably be too cold for the maids to sit in. When there
is a servants' hall this does not matter; but if the kitchen is also
the sitting-room, a small gas fire should be supplied.</p>


<h4>Slot Meters.</h4>

<p>In order to cater for people of small income whom it suits to pay
for the gas they consume in small sums, and also in some cases to check
the consumption of gas, slot meters have been introduced. No charge
is made for the meter, for the piping of the house or for the stove,
but in order to cover this more is charged for the gas. It may still
be sold at a nominal 3s. per 1000 feet (the price of gas varies in
various localities), but the person using a penny-slot meter obtains
less gas for a penny than he would do did he not require a meter.
The same applies to the "shilling-in-the-slot" meter. Small users,
however, often find it convenient to use slot meters, which entails no
first cost for installation and no quarterly rentals, and certainly
when the housekeeping allowance is small it is better to pay so much
a day or a week instead of having to face a quarterly bill; also the
constant production of pennies or shillings does bring home to the
person using the gas that it is not just gas<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> but hard cash which is
being used. In some residential hotels and chambers each room is fitted
with a slot fire and the bathrooms with slot geysers, so that the guest
knows the exact cost of fire and bath, and pays it there and then.</p>

<p>Finally, all gas users should learn to read the meter, a simple task
which the lady demonstrator will teach or which can be learned from a
card of instructions. Then the meter should be watched. If an increased
expenditure of gas is noticed the matter should be inquired into, as
there may be an escape, or some one may be forgetting to turn out the
fire or lights when they are not needed.</p>

<p>That depends on many circumstances, the length of your lease, for

in wages, in fuel, etc. Often you will find that you get back the money
you have spent in a few years.</p></div>

<div class="chap2"><p class="center noindent">CHAPTER IX</p>

<p class="center noindent"><span class="smcap">The Electric House.
Heating, Cooking, Cleaning, and Lighting by Electricity</span></p></div>


<h4>"The Poor Man's Light."</h4>

<p>Some five-and-twenty years ago, when sixpence a unit was considered
a very low charge for electricity, Colonel Crompton, R.E., C.B.,
claimed that before many years electricity would be "the poor man's
light"; and if the various supply companies had been developed on the
broad lines he advocated, there is no doubt that his prophecy would by
now have come true in every town of medium size and in many villages
in the area of supply, and we now might have been using electric
current to light and warm our houses, to cook by, and to work various
labour-saving machines.</p>

<p>As it is, there are very few places where this term can be
applied. Still, in nearly every town the charge for current has
been considerably reduced, and with the great strides which
have been made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172"
id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> the efficiency of various lamps, it can
with certainty be said that electricity is the light for those of small
means. As the charge for electricity is reduced, so will it be used on
a larger scale for heating and cooking; but at present the percentage
of people using it for cooking is so small when compared with those
using it for lighting that I propose to deal first with this latter
application of it.</p>

<p>When considering the question of illumination of a house, oil, gas,
and electricity are the three possible alternatives; and when analysed
further, bearing in mind always the question of cost of labour and the
difficulty of obtaining it, and the cost of cleaning and decorating, it
will be found that the most suitable and economical is electricity.</p>


<h4>Basement Rate and Checking of Waste.</h4>

<p>In many districts special rates are offered where heating or cooking
apparatus, or motors for pumping, etc., are used during the daytime,
also for basement lights. So when arranging for a supply enquiry
should be made as to terms. In the case of basement lights in small
houses the saving is nearly all swallowed up in the extra meter rent,
but in houses having large basements where it is necessary to use the
lights for many hours a day the advisability<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> of going on the special
rate is a point well worth inquiring into closely. In spite of the
extra hours necessarily burnt by basement lights, there is no doubt
that great waste often occurs in the domestic offices&mdash;lights are
switched on at dusk in passages, kitchen, pantry, and servants' hall,
and even when all the servants are having supper in one room every
light will be found alight in all the others. It is difficult to guard
against this, but if a small notice is fixed to the wall above the
switches asking that the light shall be turned off when not in use, it
sometimes has the desired effect. These notices can be bought ready
printed.</p>

<p>Another source of waste which was never realised until the special
constable came into being is in the servants' bedrooms. I am told by a
member of that body that one of the things which has struck him more
than anything since he took up his lonely patrol is the number of
lights which are kept burning all night in the top rooms.</p>

<p>This can be obviated by a master switch controlling the top
floor, which can be in charge of one of the head servants. It is not
advisable to have this in one of the lower bedrooms, as is sometimes
done, as it necessitates the mistress waking up early in winter when
lights are needed before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174"
id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> breakfast, and, further, might lead to
confusion in the case of a fire or illness in the night.</p>

<p>It is impossible to lay down any definite rules for the lighting of
the various rooms, as tastes differ so much as to the amount of light
required; but whatever the individual taste may be, the naked lights
should be so placed that they cannot be seen. This can be accomplished
by well-shaded wall or portable lamps or indirect lighting. This latter
form has much to commend it, as it is economical and gives an even
distribution of light all over the room.</p>


<h4>When Putting in Electric Light.</h4>

<p>It is as well to err on the side of extravagance in the number of
wall plugs. When the floor-boards are up it is not a very costly matter
to have them put in, and then when the furniture of a room is altered
from the position originally assigned to it, as is so often done with
a new house, it will not be found that the writing-table or sofa is on
the opposite side of the room to the plug to which the lamp required to
light it is attached.</p>

<p>The placing of the lights and the careful use of them would
do much to lessen the bill for current&mdash;a fact proved to me
when we let our house one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175"
id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> winter to a family of the same size, who
used the same number of rooms as we had used. The bill for light was
sent in to us, and thus we discovered that it was just double what ours
had been for the same quarter the year before.</p>

<p>I put this down to the fact that basement and passage lights must
have been burned when not needed, and that instead of using one or two
table lamps when reading and writing in the evening all the wall lights
were lighted.</p>


<h4>To Avoid Waste of Current.</h4>

<p>The staircase lights should be on two-way switches, so that they can
be controlled from each floor&mdash;that is to say, from the hall you
can switch on the hall and first-floor lights. From the first floor
you can switch off the hall and light the second floor, and so on up
the house, the reverse process taking place in descending. If the
lights are installed in this way it is not necessary to keep all the
staircase lights burning, as is done in so many houses; the extra cost
of installing is trifling.</p>

<p>In bedrooms where there are two or three lights in addition to
a table-lamp at the side of the bed it<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> is advisable and
convenient to have at least one of the lights in a two-way switch.</p>

<p>As regards the candle-power of the various lamps, so much depends on
the size and decoration of the room and the individual tastes of the
occupiers as regards the standard of illumination that it is impossible
to give any useful guide on this subject. Naturally the lowest
available candle-power lamps will be fitted in passages, bathrooms,
bedroom table-lamps, etc., but the smallest wire-drawn filament lamps
will in many cases be found to be more than is necessary. Owing to the
construction of these lamps, they have so far not been made lower than
16 candle-power for 200 volts, which is a common pressure in towns,
but to compensate for this it must be borne in mind that a 25 c.p.
metal filament lamp consumes about the same current as an 8 c.p. carbon
filament lamp, and it is undoubtedly only a question of time before
lamps of smaller candle-power and taking less current are put on the

<h4>Makes of Lamp.</h4>

<p>The invention and development of the drawn-wire lamp, made by
various firms and sold under trade names such as "Osram," "Mazda," and
"Z," have made a great saving in the annual bill for electric light,
and at the same time have raised the standard of illumination. With the
carbon filament, a 32 c.p. lamp would burn for seven and a half hours
with the expenditure of one unit of electricity. Now the same light
can be obtained for twenty-five hours at the same cost with the metal
filament lamp. Against this saving must be set the increased cost of
the lamps and the fact that higher candle-power lamps are being used,
so the saving is not as large as the above figures would indicate. This
type of lamp will undoubtedly be further developed, and the time is not
far distant when the present consumption will be considerably reduced,
so that a combination of lower charges and improved lamps will bring
the electric light within the reach of even "the poor man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177"
id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcity of labour and the difficult state of the domestic labour
market have made many people look round for labour- and dirt-saving
methods of warming and of cooking; and certainly if not as attractive
as a coal fire, an electric fire is both convenient and dirt and labour
saving; it is likewise a boon in bedrooms and other rooms which need to
be heated only for an hour or two at a time.</p>

<h4>Electric Fires.</h4>

<p>Various makes of fires are illustrated in this book.</p>

<p>A great advantage of the electric fire is that it is red-hot in a
few seconds and may be placed where it is most required.</p>


<h4>The Electric House.</h4>

<p>Now let us see how things are done in a house which is worked by
electricity throughout. A maid is awakened by an electric alarum
(she cannot say that her clock was wrong, because all the clocks are
controlled by a master pendulum). She goes downstairs, touches a
switch, and sets the hot-water apparatus going. To warm or light a
room, to set the cooker to work, needs but a touch. An electric service
lift makes the laying and clearing and serving of meals a quick and
easy matter. There are no heavy trays and cans and coal boxes to haul
about the house upstairs and down. The cleaning of the rooms is eased
by the use of electric vacuum cleaners, and when there is no dust and
smoke from coal fires the house does not become nearly so dirty.</p>

<p>The breakfast dishes are kept hot on a heater. If more boiling water
or more toast is needed, it can be obtained in a moment or two without
leaving the dining-room. If you wish to speak<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> to a servant, you do
not ring and wait for her to run up or down stairs, you telephone your
instructions.</p>


<h4>In the Kitchen.</h4>

<p>Let us descend to the kitchen. In the average kitchen the coal range
is placed where it is difficult to see the contents of the pots and
pans, and each time the cook wishes to put anything into the oven or
take it out she must stoop. To stoop and then lift a weight from oven
to table adds considerably to the labour of the day. In the intervals
of cooking the fire must be made up, and not only must all the pots and
pans be cleaned inside, but the outside becomes black and sooty, and
must be scrubbed. Dampers must be pulled in and out, and the cooking of
the household and supply of hot water attended to.</p>

<p>In an electrically fitted kitchen what do we see? A clean,
bright-looking oven and a hot plate for boiling and simmering, and
probably a grill, completed by a plate heater, all standing on a table
placed in a good light and conveniently near the sink. The cook may
sit at ease peeling apples and put out a hand to alter the heat of the
oven or hot plate, or to move a saucepan. If she is a forgetful<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
person, a red lamp reminds her of the fact that she has not switched
off the current from any portion of the cooking apparatus no longer
needed. This is not a fairy story. It is a statement of plain fact,
and one into which the public must enquire if it will solve the labour
question.</p>

<h4>Simplicity.</h4>

<p>That electrical household labour-saving appliances are no longer in
the experimental stages, and that now they can be depended upon to work
satisfactorily, is shown by the number of schools and restaurants and
canteens in which electricity is used.</p>

<p>Yet all the cook has to do is to turn the switches and so obtain
different degrees of heat. If she needs a fierce heat, she can secure
it in a moment, while if she requires a gentle heat, she can secure
that, in either case by turning a switch. If a fuse should go, it
is an easy matter to replace it, and the watchful red lamp makes it
impossible to leave the current on unawares. No one who has seen an
electrically fitted kitchen can doubt that it is labour and dirt
saving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181"
id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>In a school where three cooks were kept, two now do the work with
ease, and where a cook and kitchen-maid were needed, now that all
coal carrying, range cleaning, stooping, and so much dirt have been
eliminated, the cook does the work cheerfully and single-handed, except
for the help of a woman once a week to clean areas, kitchen stairs, and
passage, and to scrub. The cost of a woman one day a week at 2s. 6d.
plus 1s. 6d. worth of food amounts to 4s. a week; while a kitchen-maid
at as low a wage as £16, with washing, insurance, and food, would not
cost less than 18s. a week.</p>

<p>But there is not only the economy of labour and dirt to consider.
There is the saving in the food itself.</p>

<h4>The Saving of Meat.</h4>

<p>I will confine myself to the question of meat. When roasting with
coal the loss of weight on a joint is anything between 25 per cent.
and 35 per cent. A really bad cook who gallops the meat and does not
baste it can effect a shrinkage of even 50 per cent.; but, fortunately,
in this land of bad cooks there are few who sin so deeply as this.
Twenty-five per cent., however, is quite a common loss, and even good
and careful cooks will account for a 20 per cent. loss. In proof of
this weigh the meat before and after cooking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182"
id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the boast of those who cook by electricity that they reduce
this loss to 8 per cent. Even when cooking electrically it would be
easy to cause a shrinkage of 10 to 15 per cent.; while, on the other
hand, very clever cooks will bring down the shrinkage to 5 per cent.
Allowing, then, to be fair, a loss of 25 per cent. when cooking by
coal (that is a quarter) and a loss of 10 per cent, when cooking by
electricity, you have a saving of 15 per cent. on your meat bill. Put
this at £50 a year, and you have saved £7 10s. on that item alone.</p>

<p>In one case when cooking on a large scale it was found that plates
of meat which had cost 5d. could be provided for 4d., a point which
the authorities responsible for the running of canteens for troops and
munition workers might do well to note.</p>


<h4>The Cost of Current.</h4>

<p>We must now consider the question of cost of current, and here we
are in many cases up against a difficulty, for unless current can be
obtained at a reasonable price the use of electricity in the household
is not a paying proposition. Speaking without inside knowledge of
the workings of the power companies, it would appear that they are
greatly to blame that electricity is not in more general use.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Apparently few of them make any effort to induce their customers to use
current for aught but lighting purposes. The offer of a flat rate of
1d. per unit for all domestic purposes, added to an energetic pushing
of electrical apparatus and demonstration of its value, would result in
an enormous betterment in the conditions of domestic labour and in the
purifying of the air of towns.</p>

<p>There are, of course, electric supply companies who are more
enterprising&mdash;Marylebone, West Ham, and Poplar, for instance, and
some provincial town companies. The engineers of these supply companies
have formed what is known as the "Point Five" Club, their object
being to supply current for heating and cooking at &frac12;d. per unit.
Still, when Marylebone represents the only district in highly rented
residential parts of London willing to do this, I think I am not unjust
when I say that the electrical companies are sadly behind the times in
their methods.</p>

<p>It is said that the current used for cooking (allowing for late
dinner) should be 1 unit per day per person, and that the amount
should diminish with the number of persons cooked for, until, when
cooking for 100 persons, the saving would be as much as 50 per cent.
This, naturally, depends to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184"
id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> some extent upon the cook, who can,
if she will, waste current and spoil food by cooking it at too high
a temperature; for, as all cooks know, after the first ten minutes'
cooking in a hot oven the meat should be cooked quite gently. Those of
my readers who are interested in the question of electrically fitted
houses can see the various utensils, stoves, etc., at the showrooms of
the makers; they can attend demonstrations at Tricity House, 48, Oxford
Street (the Electrical Restaurant); and also add to their knowledge
of the subject by the perusal of "Electric Cooking, Heating, and
Cleaning," an excellent book, published by Constable and Co., price 3s.
6d. net.</p>

<p>At Tricity House, a most popular restaurant near the Tottenham Court
Road end of Oxford Street, all the cooking is done by electricity,
and a clever lady demonstrator will show the enquirer exactly how the
various apparatus is used.</p>


<h4>Labour-Saving and Comfort-Giving Appliances.</h4>

<p>But even when all the cooking is not done by electricity, the
would-be labour-saver may avail himself of a large number of
labour-saving inventions and comfort-giving inventions in the shape
of chafing dishes, kettles, toasters, and dish-heaters.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Examples of these are to be found in all electrical showrooms, and
these, even when cheap current is not available, may prove a great
convenience and indirectly a saving of money. In one house known to
me, where one servant only has been employed since the war, the owner
switches on an electric fire, and grills the bacon, and makes toast and
coffee in the dining-room, the table being laid and the materials left
ready over night, thus saving any breakfast cooking and table-laying at
the busiest time in the morning. The table is covered with a wrapper,
and the room is swept and dusted later in the day.</p>

<p>Another useful small appliance is the electric fan. In the sick-room
it is invaluable, also for clearing a room of the smell of smoke, and
being portable it can be carried from room to room and attached to an
ordinary wall socket.</p>

<p>For large houses there is a great demand for small domestic motors,
and great saving of labour can be effected by using them for driving
boot-cleaning machines, washing-up machines, and polishing hobs for
brass and silver cleaning.</p>

<p>Before writing these articles I visited kitchens where coal,
gas, or electricity were in use, and I have also cooked on coal
ranges and gas and electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186"
id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> cookers. Excellent results may be
obtained by all three, but there is no possible doubt that as regards
labour and dirt-saving, gas or electricity is preferable to coal. At
the same time, as one cannot in many cases use either, it is only fair
to say that some of the modern coal ranges do their work admirably, at
the least possible consumption of fuel.</p>

<p>As, however, a coal range cannot be regarded as a labour-saving
apparatus, I do not give any consideration to them in these pages,
which are, as I have already said, devoted, not to ideal homes and
dream homes, but to those where the scarcity of labour makes it
necessary to save work, and ultimately cost, as much as possible.</p>

  <h2>A FINAL WORD</h2>

<p>Just as the book was going to press I received this letter&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I must tell you how thankful I have been for your labour-saving
ideas. My cook left to make munitions; my housemaid's fancy led her to
become the driver of a tradesman's cart; the parlourmaid remained, and
still remains, bless her! I have had to rely on what temporary help I
could obtain, for cooks so far turn a deaf ear to my entreaties. Had it
not been for our gas fires, circulator, and cooker, our washing-rooms
and our lift, Heaven knows what would have become of us.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"As it is we really have managed extraordinarily well. Most people's
houses are too full of things which no one wants. Most people eat too
much and serve the food with unnecessary elaboration, and vast numbers
of women spend their lives fussing over trifles and making unnecessary
work for vast numbers of other women.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Will it be different after the war?</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Mrs. Peel is universally recognized as the
soundest and most sensible authority upon
middle-class housekeeping; she knows her subject
inside out, she has no fads, and she writes with great
vivacity and verve. She is just the person whose
advice the small householder needs at the present
time, and this practical and business-like handbook
is nothing less than a public service of the highest
quality. It ought to be on every kitchen shelf
throughout the length and breadth of the country....
Indeed, the whole volume is invaluable, and
we commend it without reserve to every class of the
loyal-hearted public."&mdash;<cite>Daily Telegraph.</cite></p>
